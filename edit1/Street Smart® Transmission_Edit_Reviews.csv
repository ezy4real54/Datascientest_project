I purchased a Control Module for my son's car and for some reason after replacing it the issue was still present. I talked to Kait and she recommended that I return the newly purchase unit and get a transmission. I had to wait for the transmission to arrive and she was very understanding by giving me an extended time to return it while I waited to install the transmission once it arrived. Thank you Kait",US,1,2022-08-11T20:13:31Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Dealing with Street Smart was one of the most rewarding experiences I've had in all of my years in business.
They were quick, knowledgeable and did everything they said they would do.
Extremely professional. If the transmission is as good as their performance I will be very happy.
I wish I had found them prior to rebuilding my transmission twice and almost a third time. I would have saved an enormous amount of aggravation and money.",US,1,2022-08-09T01:46:55Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Frank Dalessandro,1.0,"Perfect right out of the box

The transmission process was transparent and responsive end to end. I called to get quotes, and confirm the process and other information and was provided quick answers to all my questions. 4WD Transmission was shipped within days and faster than originally quoted. Once received, the mechanic installed and dealer programmed the TCM (this was a complicated install that required the mechanic to drop the engine and disconnect several other parts). However, the day after the installation and programming was complete, We drove 600 miles for vacation without a single issue. Fantastic process and product. Would buy it again in a heartbeat (though I hope I don't have to :-) Thank you....Note: Best Install pricing was obtained by going to a local mechanic and bringing it to a dealer for post-install programming.",US,1,2022-08-10T23:57:35Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Henry Felton,1.0,"My 2006 GMC Envoy Transmission Experience

The transmission on my 2006 GMC Envoy decided to quit on me recently. i did not want a REBUILT Trani. i was looking for REMANUFACTURED ones, so i searched for companies that strictly remanufactured.
Street Smart came up and in reading their profile vs the others there was no question. So now i have a transmission--who was going to install it. Many transmission shops do not want to install someone elses and you are stuck with a rebuilt one. When i asked Street Smart if they had a list of preferred installers in my area, they were happy to provide me with several. i chose one nearby that had good reviews.
the order process was easy and understandable--their website lays out step by step instructions. as to order, shipping, and return, along with a 3 (three)year warrantee better than the one year some trani places provide--Easy and Simple.

This is the best transmission replacement company I could have asked for. I replaced the transmission in my 1999 Ford F-350 last year and can not say enough good things about them. The tech support after the sale was also 5 star. I have estimates from the Ford dealership to have the transmission replaced would cost me more than $5,000 dollars. I checked around to find a better price and the best of the competition was $4500. I have been in the mechanicing trades for almost 50 years and know many sides of the business so I decided to by a rebuilt tranny and install it myself. The best warranty and service after the sale was offered by Streetsmart Transmissions so I ordered one. Even though I didn't have a real shop and my truck barely fit in it. I put the transmission in it with alittle help from a friend and my motorcycle jack. I did have some small issues with the installation, but when I called Street Smarts technical support they were awsome and helped me more than once. I feel that I made the best decision and would do the same thing if I ever had another transmission failure. I will be 73 soon and if I can do it many other people can. be sure to have a flat solid floor and be carefull as they weigh about 250+/- lbs and don't get in a big hurry. good luck, Mike M.

One off the best decisions I ever made. I knew for about two years I would have to replace the Trans in my 2013 Ford Escape. Ford bean counted on this model. The final diagnosis came from a Ford dealership which wanted to charge $6500.00 or $7500.00 to replace the transmission. I first search the local big box car part stores and then I did a Google search and found StreetSmart. I read the reviews, watched the videos, spoke with sales representatives and was impressed by the validation of the BBB and this platform as well. The final selling point was the price. In total I paid approximately $3800.00 for the transmission and installation. The shipping and core return were seamless.

My 2008 E350XLT transmission starting giving me trouble about 8 months ago. Well fast forward, and my family and I are preparing for a road trip and I need the trans fixed. I called around locally and most quotes to R&R the trans were around $4000-$4300. I decided to look online because I felt like I was getting the run around. One outfit wanted to charge me $4100 with a 60 day warranty for a used transmission. At a minimum, I was looking for a 3 year 36,000 mile warranty. I did a search online and found StreetSmart. I entered my vin # and received a quote for $2025. The other outfit wanted $2750 for a USED one! Streetsmart doesn't even charge you for the core unless (and correct me if I'm wrong,) you don't send back the old trans in a reasonable time.
Look, long story longer, I purchased the trans on Friday the 19th of May and it was delivered the 25th of May. I waited longer to schedule the install than to receive it from Strretsmart. And the return shipping was even easier. Going to the grocery store is more complicated than this whole thing was. The new 4R75E is a dream, smooth as silk. I'd forgotten how nice it was to have a new trans. I will refer everyone I know to these folks. Absolutely the best.

Ron B.,0.6,"To say that no problems were found is ludTo rebut the seller's response. I have pictures of all the leakage. The refund for labor was only issued after return and inspection of the failed transmission

I was given a refund at a rate of $50 per hour for labor after posting this review. Before that they canceled my warranty. I lost hundreds of dollars over the course of this transaction. My feelings about what occurred haven't changed. This has been a nightmare story from the beginning. I have a Chevy express van. Three different STREET SMART transmissions were installed. Each time they failed due to major leakage and each time STREET SMART only paid $50 toward removing and installing these transmissions. All the labor costs paid by me added up to more than the original price of the transmission. I finally hired a transmission expert to rebuild it and it now works as it should. STREET SMART is refusing to pay any part of the rebuild. I called before getting the transmission rebuild to find out what I needed to do. Nothing was mentioned about getting preauthorization from a technician. After the rebuilding was completed, contact was made with STREET SMART to have a technician talk to the mechanic about what was done so we could submit an invoice. They never called back. When I finally got a live person to talk to, I was told my warranty had been canceled. This experience with STREET SMART was a fiasco and I would advise others to have your failing transmission rebuilt by a reputable local transmission specialist. He's going to do his best to prevent callbacks and if you do have a problem, you don't have far to go or long to wait. DON'T SHOP STREET SMART.....",US,5,2022-05-08T05:11:44Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Gary Anderson,0.8,"After receiving a much better quote than I received from the dealership...

After receiving an unbelievable quote from the Ford dealership. We researched other options and found Street Smart to be the best bargain with local shops to install the transmission. We placed the order and contacted the local shop to confirm everything was in order. Kept the local shop informed of delivery updates. Job was completed in the expected time frame. However, not the fault of Street Smart and hard to identify the guilty party because the local shop needed to take the vehicle to the Ford dealer to have the transmission flashed so the problem could be either the dealer or the local shop. Starting the vehicle was different than before, it was sluggish. There was a check engine light on that was explained by the local shop that it may come and go while the air works it's way out of the transmission. The airbag light was on but the local shop couldn't solve it and wouldn't confirm that the light wasn't on before the vehicle was received by them. For the record it was not on when I left the vehicle at the Ford dealership for the initial cost estimate. There was a significant sound of air coming from the engine compartment that sounded like the output from the turbo was leaking out from the intake manifold based on when the noise was occuring vs the throttle position. The idle speed of the engine was 1800 when the transmission was not in gear. Drove it for 2 days and took the vehicle to autoparts store to have the battery checked. Battery checked good but could not get car to start. Had to have it towed back to the local shop. The local shop said that the starter was bad and replaced it for the cost of only the starter, no labor fees. Found and corrected the ""air leak"". Resolved the check engine light and idle speed is back to 750 in or out of gear. The only thing they left for me was the airbag light to correct. The rest of the car is back to normal, transmission is rock solid, shifts great, starts with a zip.",US,1,2022-03-01T17:22:37Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Jeff Sather,1.0,"You can trust their warranty

I believe wholeheartedly that this company operates with integrity and really cares what they’re doing. Charla has been awesome and always responds to my emails right away. Unfortunately, my transmission from them started giving me trouble less than a year after I bought it. It came with a 3 year warranty, but a warranty is only as good as the company honoring it. Anybody can sell you a rebuilt transmission, but these guys are as happy to help throughout the warranty process as they were during the sale process. They shipped out a new transmission to my mechanic right away. After he installed it, he noticed that it had a gear 2-3 shift flare. Street Smart shipped out a new valve body, but it didn’t fix the problem. So they are shipping out a second new transmission. It will arrive next week.
Street Smart is going to reimburse me part of the cost of my mechanic installing the first replacement transmission. But for the valve body work and now the second transmission replacement, they are covering 100% of the cost. Which is cool because it’s the right thing to do, but I was worried because my mechanic isn’t real cheap. With all the labor they’ll end up paying plus all the shipping costs back and forth, they’re definitely going in the hole on this deal. So if you are on the fence, buy your transmission from these people and if you wonder how good their warranty really is… trust and believe they’re gonna stand behind it.",US,1,2022-01-22T14:52:36Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Cheryl Pelphreyweigand,0.2,"Purchase and delivery went smoothly

Purchase and delivery went smoothly. Installer reported issues with the transmission to Street Smart and they did not respond for weeks. It took months before a repair was authorized and parts sent. There continued to be concerns with the transmission working properly. Because my car was inoperable during this time, and I was not getting a response from Street Smart, I rented a vehicle and drove to the address listed in Tampa only to find out that location is merely a mail drop and the shop is actually located in Indiana. Michelle attempted to send messages to executives at Street Smart however no reply was received. Ultimately Street Smart did not honor the warranty costing further expense to fix the vehicle and make it operable. The transmission was purchased in September and my car was inoperable until December. I read many favorable reviews prior to my purchase and have seen many unfavorable reviews since then.
My concerns were not just related to the switch mentioned but also the solenoid pack, lack of communication when a concern was presented, refusal to authorize warranty work.",US,1,2022-01-19T19:17:58Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Street smart Transmission is the best place to order a transmission, I went to 3 different repair shops and 2 different dealerships, they all want $1500 dollars more than what I paid with street smart.

God help you if you need warranty work done. I bought a transmission for my 91 f150 in August and already need a new one.

Price was 1000 less than a local trans shop for rebuild, and also saved on installation doing it myself. Only ding is to GM as trans needs to be programed which required a tow to my local mechanic and charges for the programing. Pickup of the old transmission was pain free.

After my mechanic told me I needed to replace the transmission in my 2004 F250 I got quite a few quotes from local transmission shops and local dealerships.. They averaged about $4k for a rebuilt tranny with 12 month warranty. I couldn't justify putting that much into my old truck, especially since I only use it around my property. I searched until I found Street Smart Transmissions. They have excellent reviews and an excellent BBB rating. I contacted them for a quote and they were very reasonable and had triple the warranty my local shops offered. The quote came within an hour! I found a local repair shop that had experience with SST. He assured me that he's had excellent experiences with SST so I ordered the tranny they specified and my shop had it installed the same day it was delivered! (And it was delivered to him within 4 days of my order!) I saved tons of cash and now have the piece of mind that my truck will be reliable. I would absolutely recommend purchasing from SST!

I ordered a transmission on July 27th, at which time $2100 was immediately deducted from my bank account. It was supposed to be delivered on Aug 10 but did not arrive with no contact from StreetSmart. I called and they told me there was a delay on parts and I would receive it on August 20th. Still no transmission. I was told it would ship on the 21st which it did not and upon further calls to them they said it was just now going through testing and they would advise me when it would ship. I have filed a complaint with BBB. They have had my money for almost a month, have not kept me up to date on status and continue to give me the run around.

My principal contact at Street Smart was Charla, but i did have contact with several other people during the process. Everyone I had interaction with was a credit to the organization. Street Smart could provide a consulting service for businesses regarding training on proper customer service protocol.

In addition their affiliated installation facility, Auto Land in Accident, MD lends credit to their veracity as well. Don Lewis quoted an estimate of $600. for the installation and it came in at $630. No padding or overages. A highly credible transaction all the way around.

I ordered a valve body ($560.00) for a 06 Beetle and had it installed by the dealership ($935.45). When I got the car it shifted worse than it did before. I put in a warranty ticket with Street Smart and they sent me a replacement. I had this installed by the dealership ($917.63). Now the car runs great. So the only difference was a bad valve body Street Smart sent me and a lot of money out of my pocket. I doubt very seriously that Street Smart is going to cover the first bill or even refund my original purchase. I would say find out, IN ADVANCE, what they will do if they send you a bad part.
Edit: Street Smart has refunded me the original purchase of the valve body. This surprised me. Still, it is $327.00 over what it should have been but I'll take it.",US,1,2021-08-19T20:47:39Z,Street Smart® Transmission

I submit the order, my money is taken, and within a short time i get an email with an invoice for a $1500 core charge. I emailed back explaining this is not industry standard especially in B to B operations. Was told they cant do anything. I sent an email back right away saying i want a full reversal of charges, that i would take my business elsewhere...and guess what NO REPLY, and NO MONEY!!!

I ordered a transmission ahead of time as the one in my vehicle has 230,000 miles on it and is starting to act up. Provided them with the vin number. Order was process faster than they projected and the delivery was pretty fast. Would have been all good if they sent the proper transmission. Spent time going back to the shop to get and send pictures. Spoke to at least 6 people via phone or email and they kept making excuses for the transmission they sent claiming it was the correct one. One of the people I spoke to said he only handled commercial accounts and mentioned Advance Auto by name. I live in a small town, we have an Advance Auto and the shop said I could look my vin up on their web site and it should tell me what I need. When I did it gave me the proper transmission with a 6 bolt converter. To double check I looked it up on other sites and they showed I needed a converter with the 6 bolt pattern. Street Smart then told me that the vin was not always accurate! HUH?!! So why do they need it. They then wanted to know if this was off a motor home? The order was for a 2003 Ford Excursion 6.8 v10 gas, 2 wheel drive. A new transmission is coming and they will be picking up the other one. Would I recommend these guys? No. Does that mean the product isn't any good? No, this could be very good and I expect it to be. Their customer service is not good and what should have taken a 5 minute phone call was about a 36 hour process that we had to lead them through. To be fair the Excursion could have 4 different engines and the 5.4 gas does take a 4 bolt converter. Nice but that's not what I have and the vin shows that.",US,2,2021-07-28T14:24:27Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Moses Perry,0.6,"I would give 5 stars but too soon to tell.

I would give 5 stars except that on day 2 of driving with new transmission there was some slipping, but I realize that while unlikely it is possible for a pocket of air bubbles to be in the fluid and working themselves out of the system. So I have been babying it and had no more slipping. I will put it to the test in due time and give 5 stars if its OK. Other than that I like everything about the way this company has made it easy to get a transmission of my choosing to a mechanic of my choosing. Even if I need a replacement transmission, and they take care of it like they say, I will give 5 stars. Transmissions are complicated,fine tuned, electromechanical components. With that in mind, getting a bad transmission is a possibility no matter where it comes from, how it's dealt with from there is what makes a company's reputation, and reputation is the key to being legendary.

The buying process was easy. The mechanics were impressed with the transmission that arrived. What didn't go right was the delivery and core pickup.

I got an email that transmission had shipped on a Wednesday evening. I called the shipper on the next day (Thursday) to see when it would show up at the mechanics shop and they said that it was already delivered on Tuesday! That cost me a whole week of not having my car.

Core pickup was easy to schedule but then I get a call from the shipper saying they were at the shop, but never got the bill of lading that was supposed to be faxed to the mechanics.

Ordered a 4L60E for a 2007 Tahoe. Arrived in about 10 days as expected. Installed the transmission and it works great.

Just be careful when buying trans fluid. Street Smart told me I needed to get 11 quarts because that's the capacity of the transmission. So I ordered it from them. For some reason it didn't get shipped, which turned out to be fortunate. The oil was canceled and they refunded the money with no issues. So I bought oil locally.

I asked SS how much oil to put in at startup and was told 9 quarts because there is usually about 2 quarts of residual oil from testing. So I put in 8 quarts and it was immediately way overfull. Sucked out about 2-3 quarts and it was at the right level. It ended up needing only 5-6 quarts instead of 11.

All the people are friendly and helpful but I would suggest they update their info on oil capacity. Because of the mistake, they offered to pay my oil cost.",US,5,2021-06-17T18:41:14Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Vince Caruso,0.2,"Worst customer service EVER.

Buyer beware. This company may tout family values and excellent customer service but that is not what you will get. Three weeks ago I ordered a CVT valve body (close to $700) after talking with a sales person who assured me the part was in stock. A week later, after the part did not show up at my mechanic's shop I called and was told the part was not in stock and the charges on my credit card were reversed. No phone call! No email! I called back and was told the part was now in stock and that I could reorder, which I did. The part was shipped, installed by the mechanic and much to my dismay, it was defective. My mechanic spoke with the company representative who told him that they could not ship a replacement part until after the holidays. This was before 9:00 am so they cannot claim it was too late to ship the part. I followed up 30 minutes later and explained that I have been without a car for over two weeks and that much of that time was their fault for not informing me that they had canceled my order. I explained the financial burden their two mistakes were costing me including a rental car and a mechanic who charges by the hour. I said that the least they could do to rectify their mistakes would be to send the part out today. She said she would check and get back to me with an answer. I explained that I had already had a bad experience with her company not contacting me and she ASSURED me that I would hear back within an hour or so. She then verified my phone number. SHE NEVER CALLED ME BACK. As I write this sentence I am flabbergasted that a company would treat a customer like this. Due to their mistakes or lack of customer service (in this case both) I now have to pay for at least another week of a rental car and pay my mechanic twice what the original job would have cost. Not shipping that part today was poor customer service but not returning my phone call is unacceptable by any company's standards. I am not a person who complains and I do not think I have ever written a negative review for anything but in this case I feel potential future customers have a right to know how they will be treated, Additionally, I plan to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau as well as any other review sites that I can find.

Regarding the company reply to this review, I have checked and rechecked my inbox and junk mail and there is NO email regarding canceling my order. When I first spoke with a company reprentative about this issue she apologized several times and made no mention of an email being sent to me. Converseley, she told me there was no record of a phone call or an email being sent. I have asked the company to produce a copy of this email. Additionally I was told that the part WAS in stock but had to be programmed so I am very confused as to why the response says it was not in stock.",US,1,2021-05-30T00:32:27Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Put back in shifted reel hard changed the valve body was better not much. Year later it went out. Came across a post that one of ur guys made about solenoid oham readings what they should be. Got the name of co Street Smart. Looked up online contacted yall like what I read. And bought one had put in again. And I can tell allready that it will last me the rest of the trucks life.

David Merritt,0.2,"I ordered my transmission a month ago…

I ordered my transmission a month ago now. When I originally ordered it was suppose to be in the next week. I then recieve an email stating the 29th. After talking with them and talking with competitors I then decided to keep my order with street smart. I am disappointed in the level of customer service they have. If I want an update I have to call for it. I then am told we will return your call and provide you with an update. I never recieve any communication back. So call again only to be told the same thing over and over. My delivery date has been postponed yet again. Had I known this was the mess I was getting into I would have gone ahead and canceled my order the competition guaranteed mine by the time line they gave me which I would have already received my transmission and most likely had it installed as well. I am in several automotive groups and several people I know that I'd talked to them about ordering their transmissions from street smart are now reconsidering the competition instead. My experience has now cost you guys a minimum of 12 transmission orders from auto club members that I had talked about ordering with your company until all the mess started happening. Possibly several more because others are still asking me about recommendations. Really lost out on this by dropping the ball here. Since I'm am not getting updates I'll update what I've found out. Thanks for the credit but I'd appreciate getting my transmission. Was suppose to go out Thursday Friday at the latest as they stated in their reply. I still have yet to recieve any shipping info. What I did recieve was another eta date of 5-11 yet doubt that's going to be achieved. So very disappointed.

Let me start by saying the customer service was okay the shipping was terrible had to drive 440 miles to go pick up my transmission because they wanted to put it on a third-party shipper instead of bringing it to the house like I paid for they did get my money back for the shipping but still it was very inconvenient and that was after I missed 3 days of work waiting for the product to show up at the house.

Now as far as the product goes the transmission I received after I installed it the lines for the trans cooler leak at the transmission the fittings were not before the F-150 I guess not sure why but the line stayed loose while the fittings were screwed all the way in when you're in a small town good luck getting parts so now I'm going on day 10 with no truck I would never buy another transmission from them again just a run-around Fiasco",US,1,2021-04-22T23:35:44Z,Street Smart® Transmission

That was April 13 and I still haven't received the new transmission. I've checked daily with the shop and also with customer service at street smart. I was never given a tracking number for the 2nd transmission. I had to call yesterday to find out who even is delivering it.

They however refunded me right away and this was probably a circumstance beyond their control.

I believe this was more of a vender problem and not so much from Street Smart Transmissions themselves.

I'm so happy I found the Street Smart quality website and that Street Smart is also Better Business Bureau certified!
Things got even better when I talked live with Lara. She took loads of time answering all of my questions on why a remanufactured automatic transmission (4T65E) would be a wise decision for our 2006 Impala. Being on the older side of life, a new or even a used car didn't make a lot of sense for someone who only drives 4,000 per year. And the lengthy warranty gives us confidence that should the transmission have an issue there are many repair centers throughout the USA that can provide service.

I order a remanufactured transmission from street smart, the shipping and core return was easy and fast. I had the reman in my 2003 Sierra 1500 for about 8k miles and the reverse went out and low gear. When the repair shop installed my first one they said that the transmission oil was dirty/used, took the truck back to the repair shop after it went out and it had been 3 weeks and still no word about the 2nd one being sent. Called street smart and they said the repair shop didn’t file a claim. Repair shop said they did and that street smart was trying to find something else with the truck to void the warranty. Called street smart again and they said they were going to reach out to the repair shop to get the claim started and I gave them my email to keep me updated and when the new one gets sent. It has been 2 more weeks and still no email or call. I would not recommend getting a reman trans from street smart. Customer service is poor and nobody has a straight forward answer for me. Will update IF street smart sends the new transmission.
UPDATE: The repair shop finally got ahold of me and let me know the situation as did street smart customer service. Sounds like I got incorrect information from the repair shop.

UPDATE!!!!!! Corey with Street Smart did get in touch with me, he assured me that they just dropped the ball along the line somewhere getting my credit back to me and it was not out of dishonesty. I was issued a credit on my card and we are good to go. I do understand that with warranty work the installer can't reinstall for free and if I had been driving my truck with the first transmission for a while, then I can see having to pay the extra, but when the new transmission does not seem to be working out of the box, that's something else. Thanks again Corey for all your help. END OF UPDATE. Ordered a transmission online for my 2010 GMC Sierra 1500. Arrived on time and was installed by the local recommended auto service mechanic. First transmission did not last the week and only got to drive my truck one day. It was determined that a second transmission would be sent and it was and it was installed. Now it has been 3 weeks to get my truck back. Here is the kicker, I was out an extra $500 because of Street Smarts first bad transmission. I was told 3 different times that I would be reimbursed, but never was. The second transmission that is in the truck right now seems to have it's own set of issues too. But to get to the point, their transmissions ain't that great and they are not honest. If you can not talk with a company that is at least honest with you, do not go near them.

Shaun Gallagher,0.4,"Good customer service, terrible transmissions and warranty

I own an '09 Nissan Frontier which suffered the dreaded SMOD issue, destroying the original transmission.

I came to Street Smart Transmission for a replacement, since they had much better reviews than some other remanufactured transmission providers and had the transmission I needed in stock. I will say they were easy to talk with and the process of getting a replacement went very smoothly, which is why I give them 2 stars instead of 1.

I paid $2500 for the transmission, and another $1000 for installation. The remanufactured transmission arrived at the shop in 2-3 days as promised, and installation went well. Things seemed good at first, but immediately after bringing it onto the highway I noticed one of the signature issues the original transmission had: a loud, distinct grinding sound accompanied by a rough vibration occurring as the transmission attempted to shift into overdrive. The sound was loud enough to be audible over the radio, and lasted 1-2 seconds during the shift into overdrive. The original transmission made this same noise while it was dying, and I was told by my mechanic during diagnostics that it was the effect of glycol (ingredient in coolant allowed into the transmission by the radiator) getting into the torque converter.

What I was told by my mechanic was that Street Smart Transmission was essentially just flipping transmissions without doing any real work on them, so I paid $3500 for a transmission with the same issues as the original. I wasn't upset at this time though, because Street Smart had a solid warranty (or so I thought). They did agree to replace the transmission for free, but the catch is that the warranty only covers up to $50/hr labor. Try finding a shop that'll work for $50/hr...mine works for $100/hr.

To sum up, Street Smart Transmission made the call to replace transmission #2 after running diagnostics with my shop, and I ended up having to pay half the labor (an extra $500!) to put a THIRD transmission into my vehicle. I fought it, because I didn't think it was right for me to pay to fix their mistake, but I lost the argument since the $50/hr warranty figure is displayed right on their web page. I was livid, but not as livid as I was when I found that transmission #3 had THE SAME ISSUE. Grinding into overdrive, right off the line. I felt like I had been scammed; I was $4,000 into this repair and I was still right where I started.

My mechanic called Street Smart again, and they recommended this ""anti-chatter"" oil to make the sound go away. To my surprise it actually worked, and now transmission #3 no longer has the grinding sound. However, I'm now wondering why they didn't come up with this solution on transmission #2, so I wouldn't have to pay for the installation of a third transmission?

Furthermore, while transmission #2 seemed pretty tight aside from the torque converter issue, transmission #3 makes a horrible clunk sound whenever I let off the gas and then accelerate again (almost as if there is slack in the unit). I'm not going to request a fourth transmission because I don't have another $500 to dump into this goddam truck, but I can't help but think that at $4,000, I could have simply gone to a Nissan dealership and had a brand new transmission installed.

Street Smart shipped my E4OD in record time and for the best price I found on the internet. It arrived in a specialized shipping container with the core return tag. When I had a technical question the customer service department answered right away and had the answers I needed.

Lucia,0.2,"Ordered: January 29; ETA: March 1; Result: Cancelled Order.

Update: Because I ordered on January 29 and the ETA was March 1, I cancelled the order and the company gave me a full refund. It’s still important to read the rest of my review if you’d like to receive your order in a timely manner.

My review has nothing to do with the transmission that I bought from Street Smart. Why? Because it hasn’t been delivered yet! It’s been 24 days since I ordered and paid for my transmission and it STILL hasn’t been delivered.

﻿My advice: Make SURE that you get a delivery commitment from them BEFORE you pay a penny!!!

I have a VERY common car with a VERY common transmission. Yet, its been 24 days and it STILL hasn’t been delivered.

I asked why it takes so long for delivery. They said, “This unit is being remanufactured specific for your vin #.”

Their price quote to me, based on the vin number, said, “Current availability: Ships within 24-48 hours.”

I ordered and paid the same day as the quote. The transmission shipped 18 days later and STILL hasn’t arrived.

Again, ﻿make SURE that you get a delivery commitment from them BEFORE you pay a penny!!!

I appreciate the company’s response. You know what’s missing? An apology.

The fact remains that your emailed quote on January 29th based on my vin # stated: “Current availability: Ships within 24-48 hours.”

If you know there’s a backlog, be honest with the customer on the quote. I relied on that when I ordered and paid the company on January 29th.

Only AFTER you had my money did the ETA change to February 19th. I should have cancelled then, but I didn’t.

Hopefully, in the future, when you tell a customer based on the vin # “Current availability: Ships within 24-48 hours,” it will actually ship within 24-48 hours instead of shipping 18 DAYS later after you have the customer’s money.",US,1,2021-02-25T18:42:44Z,Street Smart® Transmission

My interaction with street smart was a nice experience. They were friendly, knowledgeable, and personable. I had issues with the mechanic garage getting the core return slips and they dealt with it quickly. The transmission is working perfectly but I just got it back 2 days ago (Jan 29) and only have 75 miles in it so far. This review should be a 5 star but the garage that was on their “preferred list” called after my old trany was out and new one arrived and informed me they could not reprogram the trany. It cost me another $225 to have the truck trailered to a dealership and have it programmed. I have not had a chance to call street smart about this.

"Billy D. Augusta, GA",0.4,"3-Star Deduction (2021951)

3-star deduction:

1. The transmission arrived in a defective state.
The auto shop that installed the transmission made an adjustment by hand to make it work. The shop would need to go inside the transmission to make a permanent repair.

2. Street Smart Transmission would not authorize the permanent repair.
I took the vehicle back to the shop and called Street Smart in order to get the transmission permanently fixed by using the warranty. Street Smart would not authorize the repair because the hand adjustment is currently working. This leads into the reason for the 3rd deduction...

3. Lack of confidence in the transmission.
The auto shop's hand adjustment is the equivalent of a temporary fix. The adjustment would not have been needed if the transmission arrived at the auto shop in the proper condition.

Pepper Hastings,1.0,"Smooth order and install

I never thought I'd buy a transmission online, but here I am. This review is about the ordering, delivery and the installation of the transmission. (As of Jan 12, 2021, the transmission has been in for one day so I do not know about the actual quality or life of the unit, although it's working fine.)

When asking for a quote use your VIN number to be sure. You'll receive an email with a link specific to your quote. Order via credit card. I would suggest calling and talking to your chosen installer BEFORE you order just to make sure they will take delivery and to get a install quote. My install quote from Street Smart vs my actual install cost was within 10%.

About a 36 hours after ordering, I received a tracking number for my transmission. I was shipping to South Texas. My tranny started in Wisconsin and arrived one-business day earlier than my quoted estimate. Total time from order to delivery was Tuesday AM (order) to Friday PM (delivery to installer).

By Monday afternoon, we were on the road again. 2003 Tahoe, btw. Core was scheduled for pickup and the transaction was done. My re-manufactured transmission with install plus 3-year nationwide warranty was $2,145 out the door. Very pleased so far. Hope I don't have to find out how well the warranty is served.

This review is only on the business relationship for getting the transmission as the swap is only complete today, 7 Jan.
A more painless purchasing process I don't think can be created. Easy to order, easy to return the core (SS provides all the Bill of Lading paperwork too!) and they provide tracking information without the customer having to dig it out of some email link.
There was some question regarding pairing the TCU with the ECU, but I supplied the ECU info and VIN upon ordering and it appears the TCU was pre programmed properly, so that is a definite plus!!
Overall, looking forward to putting some miles on the truck now and seeing how this trans fairs with the use/abuse I put my truck through.

It's been over 6 months now and it's time to talk. I’m not happy at all about your service. The first transmission you sent leaked out the front main and my shop wasn't about to change that or it would void the warranty, so we sent it back. The next one didn't work either and the third one worked but with hard shifting between gears. My shop's (in CA.) labor rates are over $100. an hour and you only compensate for a small percentage. Very upsetting! And the wait for another one to come each time? I wish I never went with your service. Your web site sure sounded good but I made a mistake. And to top it all off, you never sent me nothing to pay my shop for the R&R. Consumer watch out....",US,1,2021-01-03T04:53:55Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Charles Lee,1.0,"Worked out great I'll buy from them again if I ever need another transmission

I purchased an automatic transmission about a month ago, but I wanted to run it awhile before i reviewed it, The price was more affordable than the other places I'd checked, and it came with a 3 year warranty so I decided to try it. The customer service was excellent they were quick to respond for a quote and to answer any questions I had. It actually arrived two days earlier than estimated. If your having it installed, it will save you some costs if you have it shipped to the business that's installing it with their permission. If your installing it yourself make sure you have the installation requirements with the unit so you can follow the guidelines to keep your warranty active. If you install it yourself the warranty won't cover any labor costs which is why I decided to have a trans shop install it, plus I didn't have the equipment to flush the system properly, They sent all the fluid and a new cooler with mine which saved me some cash. I've driven it about 600 miles and have had no problems at all. Towed my fifth wheel last week which weights about 12,000 lbs. which is why I changed the transmission, and it ran great. I've also noticed an improvement in my fuel mileage, so maybe the old trans was slipping more than I realized. I will buy form Street Smart again if I ever need another transmission.",US,1,2020-11-22T20:41:35Z,Street Smart® Transmission

We ordered our transmission in September, 2020. The transmission was received and installed shortly after receipt. After a couple weeks there was a problem, which, when reported was acknowledged, replacement parts received and installed. We have driven the vehicle frequently since all repairs were completed and for the first couple weeks had no issues. In the past three to four weeks there have been multiple times that the transmission seems to be struggling and failing to go into gear. We have just communicated with the company and got positive response. The mechanic is in contact with the company and testing will be done on Monday, November 23rd. The customer service from Street Smart has been courteous and helpful. They are working with us to get this corrected. We are looking forward to having this corrected and being able to travel again.

Well then I proceeded to wander about the installation and they even recommended an installer and so I went with that. After I ordered it I recieved an email saying it would be about 7 days before it arrived , which was fine, then two days later I open my email and the tranny was on the way to the installer, I was very happy amd surprised.

Not worth the headache!!
5/18/20 Purchased transmission for 2010 Ford Escape and rec'd on 5/26/20. Transmission was installed and picked up vehicle on 5/29/20. 6/2020 started to shift hard and unable to drive it. 7/28/2020 called and submitted claim as Transmission was shifting hard. Claim dept. said it was a part that need to be replace. 7/8/20 Vehicle went back to shop to get the part replaced and I had to pay an additional $163.50 out of pocket as Streetsmart would only pay $327.92. 9/17/2020 took my vehicle to ASE mechanic shop to inspect the engine/transmission. Mechanic advise it was the transmission is leaking and the transmission is shifting which will need to be replace. 9/21/20 submitted claim to report transmission torque convertor leak and transmission stalling. 10/5/20 Vehicle went back to the shop to replace transmission, had to pay an additional 147.61 as Street Smart only covers $575.00. 11/9/20 claim submitted as the transmission is stalling and only goes 40 miles per hour. Took the vehicle ASE mechanic shop and was told the transmission is bad and needs to be replace. When I called to submit the claim, I was told it may be my vehicle. Advise not according to a certified mechanic shop. So far I have lost more money on a transmission (transmission cost + claim 1 (163.50) + claim 2 (147.61) + loss of work day + rental. The icing on the cake was being pulled over by a police officer as I was going slower than interstate speed.

I had sent in my info for a quote SEVERAL times and it was always the same And the cheapest with the best warranty until the day I FINALLY was able to scrape the $ together. I sent for a quote one last time and then the quote sent to my email was $395.00 more than what it had been for the previous 6 months! I had called a couple times in between quotes also to ask different questions as well, well the day the quote was 395 bucks higher I called them right away and told Lara that I finally had the money and that I had been looking at this transmission for several months and that I couldn’t come up with another 395.00 until a few more months. She kindly asked me to hold and spoke with her supervisor, she came back to the line and told me that they can see that I had the previous quote sent to me several times including very recently and that they would honor the previous price! I was AMAZED! So bing bang boom, got payment made, transmission arrived about 10-12 days later with fluid as promised. In the 10-12 days waiting for it to come in my mother had an unexpected hospitalization so while rehabilitating her at home the mechanic had an unexpected illness as well, so it got to be about 2 weeks after delivery when I realized I hadn’t scheduled for the core pick-up yet so I called right away and they told me not to worry that they were noting my account and that I shouldn’t worry about it, to call and schedule whenever I was able. A full month later I called to schedule core return. Well all said and done, the new(reman) transmission is In my car and is running well! I am so happy to be on the road again! Thank you to everyone at Street Smart Transmission! I have recommended you guys to everyone I know! I wish more companies would follow your lead and do business the way it used to be done like you guys!",US,1,2020-10-27T00:36:33Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Amazing. Transmission was ordered Thu pm, arrived Wed am. Install went smoothly, core on the way back Fri. Reflash directions were spot on and easy for the tech to follow.

I was in dire need of a Nissan CVT transmission, after contacting a few places whom was offering used transmissions for almost the same price as a reman one. I decided to just get a fully guaranteed reman transmission. After checking around I found that nobody beat Streetsmarts prices and quarantines. I ordered the transmission on September 30th. I was told the delivery would be made Oct 13th. I called my mechanic a week or so later to tell him the transmission would be there by the 13th. To my surprise the transmission was delivered a week early and already being installed in my car. My mechanic told me after inspecting the new transmission, that was one of the better reman transmissions he has seen. He even said that he would start ordering from them.

Dan,0.2,"Street Smart Technical Support

Getting my transmission from Street Smart was great BUT the technical support was BAD. I had my transmission replaced. I drove the truck for approximately 300 miles. I had problems with the truck shifting too hard and other gears to soft. The automotive shop stated that there was no problem that it was the gearing ratio put in the transmission. I then asked the automotive shop did they use a scan tool to reset the adaptive memory. They stated that the just disconnected the battery. The installation instructions from street smart states that a scan tool needs to be used before the transmission is installed. I then called Street Smart. They opened up a warranty claim report. I told the operator to make sure the technician from street smart called me FIRST before calling the automotive shop. I wanted to let the technician know what was wrong and what the automotive shop stated to me about not using the scan tool before he talked to them. After me calling street smart customer service over and over again for three days and having the customer service people say that they would have the technician call me. The technician e-mails me. I now have the technicians number and I call him. He states to me that he has already talked to the automotive shop and that they said that they found nothing wrong with my truck. I explained to the street smart technician that my truck shifts hard from 1st to 2nd gear and shifts soft from 3rd to 4th gear. There IS something wrong... I then asked the street smart technician if you needed to use the scan tool when replacing a transmission. He stated that it is better to use the scan tool because you can make sure that the memory has been erased but you don't have too. The reason I ask that question was that the automotive shop I used said that they DIDN'T use a scan tool they just disconnected that battery. In the installation guide provided to me by street smart. It states that a scan tool is needed to reset the adaptive memory and disconnecting the battery is not sufficient. Failure to do so may damage the transmission or cause performance problems. I wanted to let the technician know all of this so he could ask the automotive shop questions to see if they followed the installation guide. If the technician didn't think that they did maybe he could explain what needed to be done ( like using the scan tool instead of disconnecting the battery) to see if the automotive shop would comply. The street smart technician stated that the automotive shop said that there was nothing wrong with my truck. My complaint mainly is that the street smart technician didn't do anything about the automotive shop not following the installation guide. He didn't ask questions he just took the automotive shops word that there was nothing wrong with my truck. I believe street smart needs to take this automotive shop off of there list of shops that street smart recommends to install their transmission. Obviously that shop is not going to follow the installation guidelines. Who knows because they didn't follow the installation guidelines that they may have not done other things that the install guide lines highly recommends that could down the road cause my transmission to go bad.",US,1,2020-10-23T20:41:37Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Ismael Campos,1.0,"I have to admit that I had my doubts…

I have to admit that I had my doubts about whether Street Smart is a legitimate business or a web scam. Their advertising is so good (videos, etc) it was hard to believe. So I called them and point blank asked them if they are legit. Their reaction was very professional. Right away they emailed me with all their information to help me verify they in fact are for real. I checked them out on the Better Business Bureau web site. I found complaints but more importantly I found how Street Smart was so responsive to their complaining customers and went out of their way to make things that went wrong right.

In my case, everything went by the book. The people I interacted with were responsive, friendly, and informative. They kept me up to date on expected delivery date, how to return the core, etc. No surprises.

The transmission was delivered on time to the repair shop. A minor complaint would be that the transmission oil pan was missing some bolts. Right away the mechanic called Street Smart to confirm re-using bolts from my old transmission would be acceptable and would not invalidate the warranty. Feedback from the mechanic was that Street Smart is very professional and helpful.

So far so good. I pick up my car tomorrow and will be driving it 200+ miles home. I’m anxious to verify and confirm my mechanic’s assessment that the remanufactured transmission is working very well. I feel confident all will be fine. I also believe that if the transmission fails, Street Smart will promptly take care of it in a fair fashion.",US,2,2020-10-14T04:31:30Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Rod,1.0,"GREAT EXPERIENCE WITH STREETSMART TRANSMISSIONS

Transmission issues are always so difficult and you feel helpless and not sure where to turn. Many times, we understand as consumers that we will have to pay a lot of money for the repairs to our vehicles when we have major issues. But honestly, we just want to know, or feel, like we are dealing with honest businesses that will do what they say they will do, and that will deliver on their 'promise'. I read the testimonials of other customers for Street Smart Transmissions but, most of them simply stated that they had not had any issues, ""SO FAR"" after recently having installed their transmission. I am writing this review two months after my purchase and now feel confident in my choice. 1.-StreetSmart Transmission really made it easy to order 2.-just as promised the transmission was delivered to the repair shop in 2 to 3 days! 3.- I chose a shop that they had recommended, Five Points Auto Center in Corpus Christi, Texas (I would have had no idea who to trust) 4.- The shop was professional and did an outstanding job and even returned my old transmission -always keeping me in the loop (Wow!) 5.- My 2015 Chevy truck is running like new and shifting smoothly.

I bought a transmission for my ford explorer on 6/24/2020. it was sent to the shop to be installed by the following week. I picked up the car and it wouldnt shift the next day. took it back and called streetsmart about the problem. I waited for them to contact me, but after waiting almost a week, I called them, left a message, and e-mail, and waited. long story short, it took 3 weeks to get another one sent, and installed. I was charged 850.00 to swap bad transmission for 2nd one, and had to rent my wife a car, during that time, at a cost of 284.00. I e-mailed them the copies on 8/10/2020 and asked about being refunded the car rental and the cost of changing out bad transmission.I got 415.00 refund!

twainer,0.8,"Good performance, poor case alignment

The transmission arrived in a great shipping container and the core was a snap to ship back in that same box. Absolutely a great experience as far as shipping and returning goes (I've had some really bad times with others in the past).

The transmission seems good so far, but its only got 500 miles on it. One thing that was a nasty surprise, however; the top area of the case had a weld repair--the core must have been cracked there. The repair was fine, but the weld caused the top bolt hole not to align with the engine hole. I had to remove the tranny and drill the top case hole larger by several sizes to get the bolt to fit into the engine. I should think someone would have checked for that after the repair, but apparently not--it was fully half the diameter of the bolt off-center. Drilling the case hole larger was no problem, but having to do it wasn't very inspiring as far as rebuild quality goes.",US,5,2020-08-31T01:05:58Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Stumbled across Street Smart Transmission web site and it was a very lucky stumble for sure. Very fast service, delivery and communication was second to none!!! Only a few days to get my new transmission and a day and 1/2 to have it installed and I was back on the road. They took the pain and hassle out of losing my transportation and made it at a price I could live with.

customer,1.0,"Late Delivery//Edit

I never got my confirmation email when I first ordered. It had to be resent when I emailed about the eta. When I first called about the eta the lady told me that it would be about 2 weeks. 2 weeks later I emailed and was told that it wouldn’t be delivered for another 2 weeks. And then when I finally got a shipment confirmation it wasn’t going to arrive for another week.
//
Update: The shop and street smart were absolutely amazing with everything that happened. The remanufacturer messed up my transmission, and they were supposed to expedite everything but they didn’t. Jason at Engine and Transmission Center was great and waived my installation fee due to all the problems. This is definitely where I will go if I have any other problems, and will be the number one place I would recommend.",US,1,2020-09-26T00:51:52Z,Street Smart® Transmission

W. C.,1.0,"Ordered reman transmission for 08…

Ordered reman transmission for 08 Pathfinder on July 1, 2020. It arrived quick considering it was the 4th of July weekend. It was received at Nissan around the 7th. I picked up the vehicle on the 10th. The mechanic advised he took the vehicle for a test ride but noticed the gears shift a little rough at low speeds. He mentioned to keep an eye on it but it should be good 5k miles. He stated if it gets worse then there is something wrong with the transmission.

I departed their shop and noticed what the mechanic spoke about although it was very subtle. On July 26th while driving on the highway at roughly 400 miles in, I notice the vehicle wouldn’t shift out of either 2nd or 3rd gear. I pull off the highway into a gas station to make sure there was trans fluid in the vehicle which there was. Tried going into reverse with no luck. Tried to call the company although they were closed so sent an email and called the next morning (27th). Spoke with a gentleman and he said a warranty claim could not be started without a diagnostic check. Took the vehicle to Nissan and had them do the check. Codes came back as P1764 and P1769 both solenoid issues.

It was determined that a replacement transmission would be sent but wouldn’t arrive until Aug 6, 2020 because they will need to build one for me. So far my interactions have been good with them. A few things I didn’t like…. They will not pay their portion until they receive the defective unit back from the dealer. The dealer can’t return the defective unit back until the replacement is sent. Nissan will not release the vehicle until the full bill is paid which means if I want my vehicle back in a reasonable time, I have to pay the full balance. Which means SST would then send me a check with their portion. After speaking with a gentleman in the warranty department, he said he will check to see if they can put the credit back on my credit card I originally paid for the transmission with. I appreciate the gesture but don’t feel I should be responsible for paying any of the cost for labor on a replacement transmission that was defective from their shop. Not sure if it was a quality control issue or what but there were other customers who left comments stating the same thing which leads me to believe their quality control needs to be revamped.

On another note, they sent me an email stating the total they would pay for labor would be 9.5 hours @ $50 totaling $475 which they said included fluid and the diagnostic test. Nissan said it would be 9.5 hrs to complete the job and charged me $130 for the diagnostics test. When I called about this, the rep advised the actual install time was 7.5 hours per the guide they use although they added 2 additional hours for fluid and the diagnostic. To rectify the situation the rep said he would grant the $130 for a total of $505 reimbursement. I didn’t want to argue so I accepted his offer although I am still getting cheated.

My final thoughts for Pros…Price was lowest I found online that included trans/fluid and radiator for $2690. Shipping was fast for the first transmission and shipping was included. The initial order went smooth as did the replacement order although I am still waiting on the second trans. Everyone I spoke with was friendly.

My final thoughts for Cons… I (the consumer) has to pay out of pocket for another round of installation for a unit that was bad from the beginning. They will not pay their portion of the charges until the defective unit is returned and they inspect it. This could take an additional week or more and the install shop will not release the vehicle until payment in full is made. This leaves me the consumer to pay everything upfront if I want my vehicle back in a somewhat timely manner.
Why did I choose Street Smart… The number one reason was the 3 year unlimited mile warranty. Second was the price point. Would I do it again or recommend them to anyone else.. If I didn’t have to pay for the re-installation of the second transmission because the first one was bad, yes. Otherwise no, I would not recommend them to anyone or do it again. I would pay Nissan the $3300 they quoted me and call it a day. Because of the cons, I have to give them a 3 out of 5. If the first transmission wouldn’t have failed within the 1st 500 miles they would get a 5 star rating.

********Update********* August 2, 2020
After submitting the above review, I received an email within hours from Corey the VP of sales. He resolved my concerns without hesitation and advised if there was anything else I needed I could contact him directly.

That same day I received an email from them stating my replacement trans was shipped and would arrive Aug 3. I advised Corey I would update my review because he went above and beyond to make the situation right. I want to be clear he did not ask me to update it but I felt it was the right thing to do. Highly recommend!!",US,1,2020-08-02T11:14:34Z,Street Smart® Transmission

I had bought a transmission for my 2011 VW Routan, which is really just a Chrysler Town & Country in disguise with VW badges. I was originally told that it would have to be built since it wasn't in stock @ the warehouse. It was built, shipped & to the auto shop all within a week. Turn around time was impressive.

Kiera, in customer service was very very helpful, knowledgeable & friendly!

All in all I wasn't thrilled with having to buy a new transmission, but with the pricing, free shipping & core deposit & return, I'm glad to have found this company!",US,1,2020-07-30T23:26:41Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Rickter,1.0,"You may never rebuild again

Price was scary good. Can this be as good as it sounds? Very easy to order a trans, have it delivered and schedule core return. All this included in the price?
Yes, unless you are a residential delivery like me, which is understandable. I needed a smaller truck with a lift gate. Small surcharge was worth every penny. Truck driver was outstanding because he didn't complain about my tight, 1/10 mile driveway with a residential culvert bridge. The trans was delivered with care. Streetsmart experience was clear with detailed delivery, shipping an return instructions. I had to call customer service with a couple of questions which were researched and answered. Can this be, mechanics that actually know what they are doing? Believe me, that is rare. I specialize in fixing damaged caused by other, so called, professional mechanics. Streetsmart is now my #1 stop for serious transmission issues. It doesn't make sense to rebuild it in many cases. You get a warranty and a remanufactured, not rebuilt, tested transmission. My customer was willing to wait for the reman trans rather than a rebuild for nearly the same price. !! And I don't need to guarantee the rebuild on my own nickel. Do this and you may not go back to rebuilding. The new Streetsmart transmission operated as smooth as glass during the test drive. Hoping to turn this over to the customer tomorrow.",US,6,2020-07-29T04:11:29Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Was very happy dealing with your company. Prompt response to sending new transmission to my selected installer and at a great price.
As for core return, we made several attempts myself as well as installer to contact by phone and online for a week with no response. Finally got through online and was given pick up time. Hoping it will be prior to 2 week dead line so I am not charged extra 700.00 at no fault of ours in efforts. We were attempting return for a week.

We just had the transmission installed so cannot speak of experience mechanically yet, but customer service was responsive and friendly.
The best part is that they allow the general public to purchase transmissions at greatly reduced prices and provide a listing of shops that are willing to install a transmission shipped to them as arranged by the customer. This is really helpful when the mechanic says the dreaded words ""You need a new transmission"" It really is a great system and was so kind to our household budget during this era of lower incomes due to covid19.

Kev,1.0,"Fantastic experience

Fantastic experience, start to finish.
When my F150 lost reverse and I needed to replace my transmission, I shopped around.. Aamco wanted over $2500 to rebuild my broken trans.. My local Ford dealer was of course much more. Then I found Street Smart online and purchased a completely re-manufactured unit for $1690.00
Very fair price, all new parts inside, included shipping, included trans fluid, included dipstick gasket..no up-front core charge..free pick-up and return shipping of core.. This is the BEST option when you need to replace your transmission.
Transmission feels new (it should) and has performed flawlessly over these first 1000 miles since I put it in.

My truck was setting in the repair shop and the transmission was bad. I didn't know what I was going to do. I needed my truck to get back and forth to work. So I call Street Smart Transmissions to inquire about the cost and time frame of getting it shipped to the repair shop. The price of their transmission was the best That I Found. And their warranty was better than their competitor's. I bought their Transmission and asked how long it would take to get it to the shop. The lady told me that it would ship by next Wednesday. This war Tuesday. So I said ok. I got a notification e-mail on Friday from the shipping Company that it had been delivered. I was shocked and called the repair shop and sure enough they had it and was installing it. GREAT JOB to Street Smart for helping me get my truck back on the road. I would recommend them to anyone.

Ordered on Monday-delivered way out to Montana on Thursday, Thats pretty impressive. Install went well at our local shop. The only glitch was adapting the new cooler, sent with the tranny, used a different size fitting than the OEM fittings. That added some $ to the install. After driving the truck in the Montana mountains the temp gage was getting up to 210 degrees so I called to ask what was “to hot”?
Spoke with the tranny guy ( Mike) and he said that temp was ok as long as temp came back down, which they did. Also asked about breaking period. He said to have the tranny drained, filter changed and new fluid installed between 3000 and 4000 thousand miles. Street Smart was very good to deal with.

Every aspect of the purchase was excellent from customer service to delivery, quality and price.

I was very frustrated learning that my transmission was going out in my truck. I had initially decided to take it to a transmission mission shop that specialized in their own quality rebuilds. I was not thrilled with the price we settled at or the warranty they included on their work. I was very happy to find street smart transmissions they had the best reviews, price, and warranty I had seen. They made a difficult situation into a decision that made sense. I have a new transmission that I believe will last me many many years. If it doesn't I have the piece of mind that this company has my back.

William Sullivan,0.6,"Beware of reviews, or bad luck, you call it.

OK, I selected street smart because of positive reviews. Ordered trans June16 all is good, monitor shipping and nothing shows up,calls street smart after day 3 to check on shipping. Over the course of 4 representatives I am told 4 different stories.Day4-Transmission ready to ship ( Great but no trans shipped) Day 5-Transmission needs testing prior to being shipped.(OK they are actually testing it, but no trans shipped). Day 6 Sunday. Day 7 Transmission ready to ship and will use 2 day or overnight to meet delivery date. (I knew this was hog wash) I am now resigned to getting the transmission later than June 24 but hey a fully tested trans ready to be shipped but again no trans shipped). So once again I inquire and I get the sales manager she looks into it and the trans is still being tested and admits that there is no overnight or 2 day delivery on a freight shipment. Blames shipping department on giving her staff bad information. So again I wait and nothing is shipped. June 23 I receive a voice message that the trans is bad and they are canceling order and will provide a refund. Which they promptly did. That is why I gave them a 2 star rather than a 1 star. So could they have responded better (Absolutely). It appears that this company has some internal communication problems that need to be addressed. It apparently took the sales manager supervisor to step in and provide direction to the handling of my order. Luckily I was not on the road needing prompt service. In closing I was able to get a GM remanufactured trans for $100 more great warranty, fluids, core pickup and 3 day delivery. Live and learn. Hold on to your seats, after sending my review in I received an immediate response from Cory the VP of sales for Street Smart Transmission. It was an amazing response that I would never have dreamed of. It included an apology and compensation. Corey did not ask for me to update this review and said there was need to to. But I felt it necessary. I give Corey 5 stars, and will change my 2 star rating to 3 star for the company, because I still feel there is the room for improvement in communication and process within their organization. I use reviews heavily for my online shopping and that is why I spent the time here. In closing I would say that Street Smart has earned its high ratings and I happened to experience a rare poor business transaction with Street Smart.",US,2,2020-07-01T20:38:19Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Bj NH,0.8,"Great customer service. Expect delay in shipping.

Great customer service. The only reason I’m not giving five stars is because they had to “build” my new transmission after I ordered it. Was expecting the new transmission to ship within “24-48 hrs”, and scheduled my mechanic accordingly. I did receive a call the next morning to let me know that they were building a new one for me, and that there would be a delay. The new one did arrive two days earlier than I had been told, which is good. But then I had a tranny sitting at the shop for four days before I could get the vehicle down there. Which made it hard to get the core out and returned in the window allowed.",US,1,2020-06-30T14:55:14Z,Street Smart® Transmission
Tom Stefanski,1.0,"If I could give 10 stars I would!

If I could give 10 stars I would!

This company was my second choice and I wish I would have made them my first.

I had a horrible experience with another company who took over 3 weeks before I cancelled the order because it still hadn’t shipped. I only went with the other company first because they were a bit cheaper but now I see why.

STREET SMART was the complete opposite! And we’ll worth the extra couple bucks! Charla was super helpful from The start and got me the information I needed quickly, and to top it all off, she had my order shipped within 24 hours!!!! Also, note that their warranty also includes labor for a swap (if needed) whereas the other company did not!

I got my transmission delivered in roughly 5 business days from the time I placed the order. Absolutely incredible. And to top it all off; literally and figuratively; they included the necessary two cases of ATF fluid.

These guys will take great care of you, and we’re well worth the slightly higher price. They were far from the highest price though. 2nd cheapest that I found and again, don’t get “A TRANSMISSION” just because it’s cheaper.

Jermaine L.,0.2,"I ordered a transmission for my 2009…

I ordered a transmission for my 2009 mustang. Got the transmission in a timely manner and had it installed and the transmission does not go in reverse. Spoke with Nancy on 6/16/20 and 6/17/20 and she said she would have a technician contact my mechanic. Nobody called him. Spoke with another woman on 6/19/20 and she says no warranty claim was submitted and their is nothing in their system to have a technician call my mechanic on the 2 previous dates. So I put in a warranty claim 6/19/20, mind you i still dont have my car as its still in the shop. Their website says no hassle warranty and a new transmission will be sent out once a claim is put on the warranty. Lies! Well, truth is they have my installer jumping through hoops with all kinds if diagnostics, and taking the transmission apart for a transmission that should have been sent to me in working condition. Still no replacement has been sent out and my car is still at the mechanic shop going through troubleshooting for a transmission that should have been sent in working condition. Spoke with Ashley at their warranty division 6/23/20 and she has the nerve to say they are doing this to see if anything else in my car is causing the problem. Mind you, my car was looked over by ford and nothing else is wrong with my car. I then asked to speak with a manager. She says they dont have one. I then asked for a supervisor or anyone above her i can speak to. She says nobody is available and they are all in a meeting. Mind you at this point im not happy but im also not being rude in any way. I then ask to have a manager call me back in reference to whats going on and she says ok then disconnects the line. Great customer service! Not! We will see what happens from here but if i could give zero stars i would. So now they have my money and my car has been in the shop for over a week now with replacement on the way and no end in sight. Everytime they have my mechanic troubleshoot the issue he does it then their technician has more for my mechanic to do. This is truly ridiculous and terrible customer service at best! // 6/23/2020 I received an email from the owner Corey in reference to my warranty claim. 6/24/2020 I spoke with Jake Jankowski who stated that these steps are covered and my mechanice will be paid labot for this by them. 6/29/2020 my mechanic completed the steps they asked for to diagnose what was wrong with the transmission. 6/30/2020 i get an email that the transmission replacement has been approved and they are paying $335 of which .6 or $30 is for the flushing of transmission fluid. Mind you nobody does transmission replacement for that little in my area which ranges from $500 - $600 in NYC area. I explained this the the owner Corey in an email sent on 6/29/2020 including the labor they said was covered for diagnostics. I have yet to hear back from him. I have already paid my mechanic the $600 he quoted me. I explained that i dont think its right that i should have to come out of pocket again for this as they sent me a faulty transmission and i have yet to even drive my vehicle. Also, this labor should be covered under warranty. So now i have to come up with another $265 plus $100 equalling out to a total of $965 including diagnostic labor for a problem that neither me nor my mechanic has created and obviously, based on my experience with this company, will have to fight tooth and nail to have anything done about this by this. I thought they would do the right thing by a paying customer but all in all this has been the worst business transaction i have ever experienced and i am now paying way more than i should be. 7/8/2020 i have now received the replacement transmission. Hopefully this one actually works properly.",US,1,2020-07-09T00:09:00Z,Street Smart® Transmission

I found StreetSmart on EBAY. At the time I was pricing remanufactured transmissions from their nationally know competition. Being a long time user on EBAY I looked into them.

The transmission was shipped (with regular tracking updates) to my installer. According to the mechanic it was comparable in every way to others remanufactured transmissions he had used before. He was impressed. It is installed and doing great! And with a warranty! I hope I never have to use that warranty.

To me re-manufactured equaled a complete transmission however, the trans didn't come with any sensors ( TSS, ISS, OSS or DTR). If I had been aware of this I would have ordered new parts at the time I ordered the transmission so as to not incur any unnecessary delays..
It also didn't come with the rear flange (it did include a seal and gasket for the flange).

Clayton K. Deiss,0.2,"FOLLOW UP on Bad Valve Body.

This is a follow up after I repaired the (2nd Valve Body) that was sent to me and didn't work after it got hot! I was talked down too by the staff of SST and told that the issue w/ my valve body was actually a mechanical transmission issue...FALSE! We removed and completely went through the transmission and found no bad seals or burnt clutch packs or a burnt band. It wasn't until I replaced #4 & #6 valve body solenoids that my no reverse hot issue was taken care of. BEWARE of STAFF that try to talk down to you and put the blame else where. Remember the 1st valve body came here and they didn't even have that one programmed! I had to jump through they're hoops to get a second one delivered and it only worked until unit reached operating temperature. I highly recommend buying the dealer unit and you won't go thru what I and my customer did. SST uses old solenoids which they cannot test HOT!!! especially after they take baths in Anti-Freeze!

From start to go the ordering, shipping, and return was smooth and without a glitch.
The only con of the whole experience is that there is a slight hesitation when when engaging reverse...does not grab, is not harsh, does not slip...When engaged works as should. I can live with this.
The transmission otherwise works smooth.
We will see what happens 200,000 more miles down the road.

Rick R,0.2,"Not a good company for repaired transmissions. Poor quality and workmanship gives you a 1 year tranny

So I purchased a transmission from these guys a little over two years ago.. The initial purchase went very smoothly and the transmission was received and installed with no issues. About 12 months after the install, the transmission completely went out. I took it to my mechanic and they identified the transmission failure. I contacted street smart and enacted my 3 year warranty for replacement, which also requires me to pay 40% of the labor to replace the transmission. The replacement transmission came and during the install it was found the the torque converter that was shipped with the transmission was bad. So the transmission had to come back out and we had to wait for a replacement torque converter for my mechanic to replace... and also cost me 40% of the labor cost to swap out the torque converter and to install the repaired transmission a 2nd time. The repair was good and I took my truck home. Fast forward 11 months and the transmission goes out again!!! This time Street Smart takes FOUR WEEKS to ship out my replacement transmission and then refused to pay my mechanics (who subsequently held my truck until payment was received) until they received back the damaged transmission. I once again had to pay the 40% labor and the total time i was without my truck was 7 weeks, which cost me a weekly rental to get to and from work. All in all this ""warranty"" has cost me over $3000 out of my pocket due to the poor workmanship and quality of the re-manufactured transmission. I have less than one year left on my warranty and am willing to bet my paycheck it is going to fail again. My recommendation is find a better remanufactured transmission company so you don't have to keep forking out thousands of dollars each year when the crap these guys sell fails. The least they could have done was covered the costs beyond the first replacement if they were truly selling quality transmissions. But this company does nothing to make up for the extra costs to you and I. They do not care about you.",US,2,2020-04-21T21:48:23Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Street Smart Transmission's service was second to none, although their recommended mechanics were not good recommendations. Street Smart's website said I could get the installation done for $604, but the only one of their recommended mechanics, that I could get a hold of, who had never heard of Street Smart, quoted me $855, without any guarantee on his own work, because I supplied the part. I finally got it installed for $785, from a reputable local mechanic, who was very impressed by Street Smart's service. Street Smart supplied all of the transmission fluid required, too! Overall, I would use Street Smart again, and would highly recommend them to friends and family. Thank you Street Smart.",US,1,2020-04-14T19:07:05Z,Street Smart® Transmission

customer,1.0,"My installation mechanic did a…

My installation mechanic did a professional job at installing the transmission. They flushed the cooler lines and put in the quality synthetic fluid that came with the transmission, I don't know where the transmission was made, by whom it was made and neither can I be sure that it conforms to everything that street smart transmission says in the facts about the unit such as the quality, details of manufacturing or if street smart is simply a third party ordering a unit made by another group of transmission re-manufacturing facility that street smart merely orders it and drop ships it or whether they had the transmission in their hands and actually had a quality group as stated on their site who performed everything stated. Edited: I now see that they are listed on the site that the transmission was shipped from so they must be the same Florida group. How do I know when the shipping label comes from a northern state far from Florida and perhaps a warehouse where any buyer or sales company could purchase without going through street smart? I will investigate though just so I understand more and see if I will use street smart transmissions again. The unit does quite well but it may last a few hundred miles to a few hundred thousand miles, no one can know. But so far it's lowered my fuel consumption to a record high and I will be tracking my mpg from the next two or so fill ups. I have an LT1 engine with just under 98,000 miles on it.

customer,1.0,"Saved money by using Street Smart VS Dealer quoted cost

I chose to supply the transmission to the dealer that was doing the repair instead of letting them supply it. I saved considerably over their quoted cost to me. I found Street Smart Transmission while researching for a replacement online. At about 10PM that night, I requested a quote and within a few minuets, I received one by text msg. I wanted to place an order and only seemed to be able to do that through the link that was sent to my phone vs their web page. Their web site seems to only provide purchasing by sending you a quote and link through email or text? I tried placing the order via the link on my phone but I did not see the option to pay using paypal credit. I wanted to do this so I could use the 6 month same as cash. The next evening I did an online chat with them describing the issue and was sent a purchase order so that I may use the paypal credit. I also made a call to them the following morning just to be sure they had all the correct shipping instruction for the dealership it was shipping directly too. I got a quick response and all was good. Street Smart had the transmission shipped in just a couple of days. I contacted the dealership to be sure they received it and if their was any issue with what had been sent to them. They said everything was good with no issues and should have it installed in a couple of days. Once the job was finished, I used the link that was sent to me via text from Street Smart to give them the fax# and email for the dealership. They then sent them a shipping label and the transmission was picked up the next day. Though it wasn't as simple as just letting the dealership handle supplying me the transmission. I felt it wasn't that difficult ordering from Street Smart and they saved me a good chunk of money. Street Smart was prompt and courteous with response in regard to the quote, online chat, and the phone call. They came through as they stated on their web page with quick delivery, no upfront core fee, hassle free pick up. Though the transmission is working trouble free, I feel good about them standing behind their warranty if need be because of these actions. Their quoted rate for covering labor per HR is well below dealership rates but probably more inline with an independent repair shop. All in all very satisfied and happy with my decision to use Street Smart Transmission.",US,2,2020-04-05T21:16:38Z,Street Smart® Transmission

My mechanic was equally impressed with the speed of delivery, quality and packaging of the newly refurbished transmission. The turn time for the core pick up was also very smooth.

Jay in New York,0.8,"This is a real NON-PAID review.

First off, 4 stars is a Great rating in my opinion. Street Smart Transmission and its affiliates are very good at what they do. I purchased a replacement transmission for my SUV and installed it myself. Everything as far as getting the new transmission to me in a timely fashion and the core returned to them was very fare and over the top professional. The customer service is top notch every time I called with a question and the person I talked too at Street Smart was very helpful and very understanding to my situation and specific needs every time I called. I am a Automotive Technician and will do business with this company whenever the situation calls for a replacement transmission.

Initially I was a bit skeptical and unsure of this company.

Everything went without a hiccup!
Now, time will tell whether or not the transmission I received is a good one or not. I have not problem thus far, installation was only a month ago.

Russell W,1.0,"OK.. ordering was easy the price very fair and a pretty good warranty

OK... So I needed a transmission to replace the one that would no longer even get out of first gear on my 2005 Dodge Dakota. Of course not wanting to sink a lot of money into the truck since it's 15 years old I found street smart transmissions and red quite a number of good reviews from prior customers they've had. I got what I thought was a pretty good price on a remanufactured transmission for my four-wheel drive truck and they shipped it straight to the mechanic and his business which was also on the street smart website as a recommendation. The mechanic who installed my transmission did it for about $80 less than the estimate shown on the website. I have my truck back as of yesterday March 20th, and everything seems to be fine and I am back driving the Dakota again. Street smart was very very easy to use and it was very easy and fast to order the transmission I needed from their website at what I think is a very fair price. Street smart did not charge me for a core as long as the core was returned within 2 weeks from the time the order was delivered at the mechanic shop. Simply clicking a few buttons on their website and from the email they sent me scheduled a pickup of the core from the same mechanic shop at no charge. It doesn't get much easier than that and I feel I picked the right company to buy my remanufactured transmission from. Also, I'm supposed to have a 3 year 100,000 mile warranty on this transmission which is very generous and a good selling point. Thank you street smart transmissions I will recommend you to others. R.

To schedule a core pick up was just a click and provide shop fax/email. I can honestly say if I ever need another transmission (hopefully not) I would purchase from Street Smart. I did shop around prior to finding Street Smart online and their pricing is unbeatable and their customer service as well!

Replaced a transmission on my 2008 Cadillac escalade esv. AAmco wanted anywhere from 3800 to 4200 for a rebuild. A friend quoted me over 3000. I found street smart on eBay. Less than 2200.00 . I immediately went to their website and was impressed with their procedures. Submitted a guide and they responded very quickly and with the same price on eBay. Sent in my vin number and was good to go. Delivered to my mechanic as advertised. My mechanic said it went in like butter. After having it flashed to my truck computer it shifts better then a new one. All the upgrades from the value body to the torch converter exceeds oem specifications.

"Paul Roberts, 2015 Silverado, 4x4. 5.3L, 6L80 trn",0.8,"From the order

From the order, to the receipt, and to the core pick-up, pretty flawless.
The two week limit on having the core picked up did create some stress with the timing, though.
When I received my new my transmission, I had to wait a week to give my mechanic a visit. That left me with only a work week left, to ensure that everything was shipped back, on time.
I have a feeling they would have “stretched it” if I needed, though.
They seem responsive, there.
My rebuilt tranny shifts as it should.

Time will tell more about the transmission but I don’t anticipate any trouble.

Hopeless in Ky,0.8,"Faulty transmission delivered, But stood behind it

Received Transmission on time however it didn’t work. Local Ford dealer installed this rebuilt and upgraded transmission only to find that the bolt in the pan was stripped , leaking,Psi over 200 and was shifting gears worse than my original 1995 transmission. Mechanic believe it has a faulty pump.
I called and this is being treated as a warranty issue
I have called Warranty number twice. second time was told they are sending a tech to look at it. when I asked when they would be out to look at it so I can decide if I need to get a rental car was told to watch my emails. I asked again when the tech would be looking at it & was told it will be today. Hope they really do have someone standing by in Franklin KY but find that hard to believe.
In the end a second transmission was sent. When it delivered and installed had problems with PSI and hard shifting but street smart had one of there Techs work with ford tech to identify the problem It was a sensor that interfaces with the transmission Ford replaced and it resolved the issue
I truly appreciate the extra effort made to get this fixed by both Street Smart and Ford. So Happy to have my vehicle back it took longer than I had hope but in the end they stayed with it and provided the support needed

In your ad, it sure seemed that transmissions were ""Remanufactured in house"". Well, it arrived in Orlando & the core goes to Wisconson, I think. Pretty deceptive.

Bam Bamm,1.0,"On the road again!

Driving home from work about a month ago, the transmission went up on my '01 Durango. I only have 114k on the clock, and never had a major problem prior to this. I had to make a quick decision on buying a new vehicle, or taking a chance on a transmission repair. Neither option sounded good to me, but having a $300 car payment every month for 5-6 years definitely sounded bad. I love my truck, it's been great to me for the fifteen years I've owned it. So, I had to educate myself pretty quickly on transmissions. I went from knowing very little, to now feeling like an expert in transmissions.

Having my transmission rebuilt seemed like a good option at first, but then I did my homework. A remanufactured transmission was definitely the way to go, after many hours of research. I searched the internet religiously for remanufactured transmissions, and that's when I found Street Smart. Like most people, I was extremely skeptical about an online transmission purchase. The reviews for Street Smart were great, so I took a chance. The ladies at Street Smart were very helpful answering my many questions. Nancy... Mary... and Char, were all wonderful. Thank you, ladies!

I have about 600 miles on the new trans now, and couldn't be happier. The shifts are all smooth and on point. My truck runs better than ever now. I hope I never need to use the warranty, but it's great comfort knowing it's there. So glad I found Street Smart! And, YES... Street Smart is a legit company.

First, shipping was fast. The transmission got to the garage before I did.
Second, my mechanic was impressed with the condition and overall status of the transmission, et al. There didn’t seem to be any differences from local options,... beyond the price.
Third, no issues or red flags on the install.
Fourth, returning the core was a breeze.
Finally, so far so good on the Street Smart transmission. One week in, and seems to be shifting smoothly without issue or concern. I’m now confident enough, based on that performance, to take it out for a longer trip this week. I will admit that I was originally worried about a mail-order transmission, but after this experience, I would have no problem passing on the recommendation to others.",US,1,2020-02-14T20:43:13Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Communications,0.6,"Beware their warranty department- with update.

Beware their warranty department. Jen who is a supervisor and needs to relearn the customer service end of things is extremely rude, talks over the top of you and treats you like your 12. She then demands respect after such rude behavior when you call her out on it. The warranty as ""per their policy"" is that if the repair is done they have to get the old transmission back in their warehouse and look it over before they issue an kind of credit in the labor for work. I was looking at another two weeks without a vehicle based on their freight times (7-10 business days) from Cheyenne back to Milwaukee standard freight. Cory was nice enough to issue a credit back to my card so I could pick up my truck after the snide and rude comments from the warranty department. Having the email read back to me like some teenager that didn't understand the lesson was the straw that broke the camels back. I wasn't having to expect a second repair in the first transmission wasn't shifting and was told another had to be shipped. That put the repairs on the truck for a second time out two more weeks and almost a month without a vehicle to drive. If you can help it DO NOT deal with the warranty department because they do nothing to help you in the long run.

02/14/2020 Update, Cory at Street Smart refunded me the whole cost of the repair. While Jen who is not longer with the company needed to go Cory needs to be praised for his demeanor and candor with dealing with this issue. They did in the end up the labor time from $50 to &5 an hour but after the issues that came about they made sure I was refunded the whole cost of the second installation. Hopefully I don't have to have another Transmission installed but if I do I will be dealing with Cory to have it done.

We purchased a 2008 Explorer with about 200K miles on it. The transmission appeared to be ok, but very soon the car would not backup. A Ford mechanic diagnosed the problem as needing a new transmission. We found Street Smart online and found a rebuilt at a reasonable price, but addons (delivery to a private residence, state sales tax) raised the price slightly. I paid for a box truck delivery but it was sent in a 40 ft semi. I had to use my farm tractor and forks to take delivery 1/2 mile away. The installer wound up in jail, so I had to find a garage for the job. The transmission plus starter was switched for an additional $700. That was still reasonable, considering what a dealer would charge. Core pickup has been scheduled.

RS,1.0,"E4OD - Good Quality

I have only had the transmission in the truck for a short time, but so far I haven't had any issues with it. It arrived quickly (much faster than they quoted me!) and I always got prompt responses from customer service. The transmission was clean and painted, and it appears they put care into their builds.

I did have two concerns, but fairly minor ones:
-The transmission was able to slide around a fair bit in the shipping container, and had some small dents and paint scratches on the drain pan (possibly from the core, possibly as a result of the sliding, I'm not sure), however, they did not compromise its function.
-The part of the dipstick/fill tube that inserts into the main body of the transmission was pressed in at the wrong angle. I was able to drop the pan, tap it out from the inside, and re-angle it. It would be almost impossible to know the correct angle from the factory, however, they might recognize this and ship it uninstalled.

Overall I have had a positive experience, and as long as it continues to run smoothly, I am comfortable with a 5-star review.

Edit: the transmission was missing a small plug in the bell housing. They offered to reimburse me if I was able to find one, so I submitted my receipt and they sent me a refund almost immediately!

I called Street Smart Transmission and asked about a price for the transmission for my 2008 Buick Enclave. They told me what they needed to know to enable them to give me their price. I provided the information and, within 10 minutes I had my price. I checked online, through Google, to see how their price compared and they beat almost everyone. However, I chose them anyway for several reasons. (1) 3 year unlimited mile warranty - (2) No delivery charge when delivered to a business address - (3) no core charge and no charge to pick up the old transmission and return it to them - (4)with the above benefits, two other places beat their price by less than $200 - my decision was a no-brainer. I now have the transmission in my car and it is fantastic! This is, by far, the best transmission business I have ever done business with, and I am 72 years of age, a reasonable skilled, trained mechanic and, at one time, actually managed a dealership service department. Even individual mechanic shops should be doing business with this place. They would save their customers a lot of money, save themselves a lot of hassles, and ultimately give their customers better products. Win, win, win...

This was the most Street Smart decision I made after doing my homework and learning differences of a rebuilt and a remanufactured transmission. My truck will stay in family as a long term plan. So it made sense to buy something with good warranty, a good better business rating, and qualified installer.
After talking to Street Smart on the phone, receiving quote and clarifying all final questions. We did the deal, shipping went smooth and fast. The installer promised me next day after receiving and then it was ready all earlier than initial planned schedule. My Suburban C2500 runs smoother and performs like a much newer truck. I couldn’t be happier.

Excellent experience. Shipping was fast and delivered on time. Unfortunately, the original transmission that was shipped was faulty. It had intermittent and inappropriate upshifts and downshifts. After 1500 miles of trying to get it to work, I had enough. I took it to the shop that installed it. They communicated with Street Smart directly. Street Smart agreed to ship a replacement transmission. I was concerned that I might have wasted my money by choosing Street Smart. Replacement transmission has 1000 miles on it and I have not had one shifting issue.

StreetSmart took my concerns to heart. They exceeded my expectations for this whole process. I choose Street Smart because it appeared their products were good quality. I did not expect their customer service to be as good as it is. They communicated well and they were prompt at addressing my concerns.

I will not hesitate to recommend to everyone I know. Great Job Street Smart.",US,1,2020-01-15T00:52:24Z,Street Smart® Transmission

I have a 2007 Ford F-350 Super Duty Lariat 4wd with 530,000 miles. I was having issues with my transmission and thought it would be a good time to install a new one before it became an emergency so I shopped around.
I had seen Street Smart on Amazon, Ebay etc and have seen the reviews. I also spoke with a few local repair shops and was told that they hadn't had any bad experiences with their transmissions so I bought one and had it delivered.
Two days later my repair shop got it installed and afterwards we noticed a bad vibration. The problem seemed to be that the torque converter was out of balance. I called Street Smart and spoke with their tech and he agreed. Street Smart sent me a replacement and I had it two days later. They told me to bring it to their recommended installer and they would cover the change-out completely or have my repair shop do it and they would fully reimburse the charges.
I elected to have my shop swap it out and the truck drives and shifts like a new truck.
I'm writing this review because I understand that poop happens and when it happens, it generally happens to me.
How a company handles it speaks volumes about the company itself. I honestly don't believe that Street Smart could have handled it any more professionally and I appreciate them stepping up.
Not only do they have great pricing, they are great folks to work with. When a friend of mine tells me that he is considering a new transmission, I plan to dial up Street Smart and hand them my phone.

I have a 2004 mercury mountaineer with 215000 miles and is my second vehicle.

I found street smart on the web and liked the reviews and the web site, and the warranty that comes with it ,all for $1970 out the door. They were very helpful with any questions I had. When the transmission came I took a couple weeks two install because I did it my self and was in no hurry. Everything went smooth on the install except I forgot to remove the cooling line adapters from my old transmission case , I found some on ebay and also installed a new radiator since i had the trans cooler out to be cleaned.

After my transmission lost 3rd, 5th, and reverse, I called all around trying to find the best deal possible.

Every shop could only guarantee 1 year or 12K miles. Street Smart has a 3 year unlimited mile warranty. Lastly there is no up front core charge. They just ask that you send them your old trans within 2 weeks of the new trans being delivered. And scheduling the core pickup was as easy as 123. I found a shop local to me that had a reasonable labor price and paid for them to swap out my old trans for the new trans. Best price, best warranty, free shipping.

On the whole the buying experience was seamless. Charla was fabulous to deal with and the replacement tranny arrived in about 3 days. On small shaft was missing but the seal for it was provided. Not sure if this part was supposed to come or not. Regardless used the old one and it was fine. Providing the ATF synthetic fluid was a great bonus. So far it runs like new and I hesitate to boast too much as I only have a few hundred miles on the transmission. I can say I would deal with Street smart again with no issues.

Dave in N.C.,1.0,"06 Escape, CD4E with typical premature failures/issues

Top notch product and folks standing behind it!
My 06 Escape had the typical ""issues"" common to the CD4E transmission and I happened across StreetSmart as I researched whether to scrap vehicle or repair. Mary took the time to answer ( or get an answer) to each question I posed during decision to choose them. The assurance that the StreetSmart ""REMANUFACTURERED transmission"" had upgrades and improvements Ford neglected or overlooked (nor had they addressed in ""on the shelf"" replacements, judging by some of the online complaints...) along with a three year unlimited mileage warranty!?!? You can't offer that kind of customer assurance and remain in business without a quality product. I read every review on here, noting ratio of good vs. bad as well as the responses from StreetSmart and committed to ordering. They kept me ""in the loop"" from initial ordering through shipment to delivery as well as follow-up once their recommended installer began the swap. Tough decision, invest in one of the most expensive, major repairs to a vehicle aside from an engine or the most expensive alternative, buy another vehicle? I wholeheartedly recommend StreetSmart due to the quality of their product and peace of mind that my Escape performs as it should and will hopefully for years to come. No matter who you chose, do your homework. Read ALL reviews, everything on a company's website, compare warranties and call to ask questions. Talk to more than one ""recommended installer"", if there are any. Be informed!",US,1,2019-10-15T20:38:46Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Craig,0.8,"I probably should wait to do this until…

I probably should wait to do this until I road test the new tranny but that's what warranties are for, right?
I encountered a number of issues that I want to bring to attention. First, my email contact from StreetSmart said that my tranny was being sent by truck and that it would be delivered on a certian day and that I would be contacted by phone first, especially since, as I explained during the order process, that often no one capable of operating the forklift was there. It was only by dumb luck that I was there the day it arrived, early and unannounced.
Then there was the issue of the tailcone. I had a rather harsh surprise when I found that I was required to use my old tailcone. Nothing in the order or website ever made mention about this. Not that it was a huge issue in this case because my tailcone was usable but it would be just good communication to inform customers of all details. I might have needed to get parts not included.
Which is the basis of my next issue. My tailcone was different from the parts sent, mainly the tailcone output seal and sleeve bearing. I contacted the StreetSmart and gave them the specific details of the right parts. However, that was on a Saturday and no one could do anything until Monday. Once I talked to StreetSmart on Monday, they promptly sent the new parts, which did not get there until late Wednseday afternoon. As I was tired of sitting on my hands, I purchased the parts locally. What I did recieve was a second set of the parts sent with the tranny and the right parts. Why both could not have been sent along is curious but understandable. Not like it was a huge expense to buy locally, just inconvenient to wait for the better part of a week for sake of a few bucks.
I was impressed with all of the notices attached to the new tranny. Very good to know about details, but there was one detail that I had to contact the service line for; was the toque converter prefilled? I had gone to the StreetSmart website and downloaded the installation instructions prior to beginning the install. Not that I've never done this before, but I wanted to make sure I missed nothing vital. First item on the list was to ""prefill the torque converter with one quart of fluid."" I know this tranny was dynamically tested so there should be fluid in the converter. However, past experience has taught me that there is danger in removing the converter as it can damage the front seal . I called tech support and she was very nice and helpful. However, a simple label stating that the prefill was not necessary or editing that detail from the online instructions would have eliminated a lot of angst, and a ten minute wait on 1-800 hold.
Hey, you asked...
So, my tranny is up and bolted in place but I have to finish this today. And find out if I have a warranty issue...

Bob,0.6,"Unsure about this transmission

UPDATE:
After much going back and forth, it was determined that the transmission is faulty. It slips in reverse and can get stuck in 3rd gear when the transmission gets heated up. I tow a small 1,200 lb trailer and had issues after climbing the hills in central MA. They have sent another transmission very quickly and is due to be replaced next week.

The only issue is that under the warranty, they only pay $50 per hour. Try and find a shop that charges $50 an hour. It will cost me another $450 to have installed. This doesn't sit well with me, since I noticed the issue with the transmission right off the bat, and have only driven the vehicle a couple of hundred miles since the replacement. I sure hope this next one will work out.



Unsure about this transmission. So far (about a week) I have run the Explorer on it's own and towing a small trailer, probably about 1200 pounds. I have a V8 and tow package. When traveling the first time with the trailer, after being in stop and go traffic, as I got out of the traffic it wouldn't shift past 3rd gear. I had to pull over and turn the motor off. I waited a minute, restarted and it ran fine. A week later towing again, after traveling about 30 miles mostly highway and no traffic, as I tried to back in to my driveway I couldn't get much power. It felt like it was slipping like my old tranny did. The next day I had no issues in reverse without the trailer. This is why I am unsure. Most of the time it has been great. I am going to keep driving it to see if problems persist.

Transmission did function properly from the moment it was installed.

Have called several times for customer service/warranty info, but they have never called back. Only once did I happen to actually speak with a rep when I called for assistance, and they told me they needed the fault codes and notes from the installer.

When I ordered the transmission I expected it to arrive in 24-48 hours like they advertise. Straight from the email they sent me ""Current Availability: Ships within 24-48 hours. Shipping ETA 2-4 business days."" It took 11 days to arrive (9 business days). It all worked out in the end but I was disappointed with the delivery time line.

My re-manufactured transmission has only been installed for a week. However, purchasing the unit from Street Smart has been a 5-star experience all the way.

I told my mechanic I had located an online seller of transmissions and gave him Street Smart's price. He said he would check locally what was available, and we could compare prices. He called me a day later and said no one could come close to Street Smart's price.

I have a 3-year Street Smart warranty on the transmission, so I feel I made a good decision. Customer Service at Street Smart is first rate. They quickly answered my questions by email or phone.

Street Smart coordinated with my mechanic for the return of the core transmission. All shipping is included in the price. I highly recommend Street Smart.",US,3,2019-08-29T15:36:39Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Really an outstanding purchase experience.
Transmission was delivered the day after I ordered it !? Who do they think they are? Amazon Prime or something? :-)
Anyway, Tranny was an exact fit/replacement. No problems with installation. Works great. No leaks, no noise, just doing what a transmission is supposed to do :-)
Nice that all of the ATF was provided. Top grade synthetic to boot.
Drained my old tranny and put it in the crate that the new one came in scheduled a core pickup with Street Smart and …. you guessed it. They picked it up the next day. Crazy fast !
I literally saved myself $2,000 by purchasing from Street Smart and installing myself. :-) :-)
I do have two very small improvement suggestions.
1) Label the fill tube o-ring that comes tie-wrapped to the bell housing. I wasn't sure what it was for and called to confirm.
2) When transmission is for a 4WD vehicle, supply the tranny to transfer case gasket. They don't cost much, but I had to go get one.

The Allison transmission in my Chevy pickup went bad suddenly in July 2019 and I had it towed to a reputable transmission shop in my area. They got a quote on a junk yard transmission with a 30 day warranty that was only $1,200 cheaper than a remanufactured one from Street Smart! I priced other reman vendors and Street Smart had the best warranty in time, miles, and labor reimbursement-- exactly what the transmission shop said to look for in a remanufactured transmission. My new Street Smart transmission was delivered quickly, included the synthetic fluid (saving me money), the bad transmission was picked up from the shop quickly, and the shop was happy with both Street Smart and the new transmission ( it works perfectly). And the best part was they were hundreds less than the other vendors ( and over $1,000 cheaper than a reman through GM).

I had a price from the dealer for my 2007 GMC Sierra Truck for a rebuilt transmission. The price was $3,596 installed. I searched online just to make sure their price was fair and came across Street Smart Transmission. The price for the transmission alone was only $1,580 from Street Smart and then another $550 to get it installed at Bowman's Garage here in San Diego. At first I was reluctant to pull the trigger so I called and talked with Nancy and Street Smart. After talking with Nancy I felt very comfortable moving forward. I purchased the transmission from Street Smart, they shipped it directly to Bowman's Garage and Greg and Robert installed it. It is running perfectly.

I am a self installer. I was unaware that if you install a transmission yourself and it fails under warranty, Street Smart DOES NOT COVER ANY LABOR COSTS. After just enough cycles for the check engine light to come on, I got a P2764 TCC Pressure Control Valve Circuit Low Voltage failure. I'm thinking that I read they did pay for labor up to $50/hour, but now I'm told that if I want to take it to a shop to have the failure repaired, it is on me to pay for the labor. That is simply wrong. My time and labor has just as much value as a shop. I bought this remanufactured transmission thinking it was a smart thing to do. Not so. If I had it to do over, I would have simply called a junk yard and sold the car to them. Now I'm stuck. $1800 and a ton of labor, and the car still has a bad transmission.

I originally gave street smart transmission 3 stars because I had to buy a part for the transmission to have it installed; and I thought the transmission was to come complete ready to install.
Cory from Street smart immediately contacted me asked what had happened; I explained to him and upon giving them a copy of the receipt showing the extra charge they immediately refunded the amount the part cost me... $85
This shows me that they care about their word and their customers. So I updated my stars to 5 even though I have not had time to really use the transmission. I believe that a company that reacts that quickly to a concern will stand behind their warranty.

Brian Stearns,1.0,"I ordered a transmission for a 2011…

I ordered a transmission for a 2011 Nissan Titan after my trans reverse failed. This is a common problem for this transmission model. I first approached my local Nissan dealer for replacement but was put off by the high cost and short warranty. I researched and chose Street Smart from its excellent ratings and 3 year warranty.

I chose an reputable shop and ordered the transmission. Delivery time was excellent and after driving the transmission performed as good or better than I expected. Sharp shifts. However...

There was a glitch and the manual shift and Tow mode did not function. This is the only real option this basic work truck has and was important to me. Took truck back to installer and they engaged Street Smart technical support with a quick response. There were complications with the TCM, Transmission body, and programming that my installer was not able to work and I took the truck to Nissan Dealer for programming. Subsequently I was informed there was a mix-up between transmission hardware, TCM and programming and my existing combination would not work. At this point I was out of time as I needed my truck operational for upcoming family vacation and hauling a boat. I chose to return the transmission to Street Smart an have Nissan install one from factory specs.

Street Smart refunded my purchase cost and also reimbursed me for the initial installation plus additional out of pocket costs incurred.

I believe this event was a technical glitch and not representative of Street Smarts excellent BBB rating and other reviews. I would recommend Street Smart Transmission to others.",US,1,2019-08-07T21:38:27Z,Street Smart® Transmission

I had to replace the automatic transmission in my F-250 7.3 pickup.
I chose a remanufactured unit from Street Smart Transmissions and had a local shop do the swap for me.
The trans arrived earlier than expected, the swap went smoothly and my 21 year old truck runs like new - what more could you ask for! I have put a couple of thousand miles on it so far.
The only issue was that the transmission was shipped without the trans fluid that was supposed to come with it so the shop supplied the fluid and added that charge to the bill. No problem, Street Smart promptly refunded the amount of the additional charge.
Couldn’t be happier - unless of course my trans hadn’t gone out.

I have waited for a few months to post this review, so I could give a good honest review.

I have a 95 F150 with a 4R70W tranny. I shopped around online for about a month and called different companies trying to find the right one. I spent hours researching on the BBB and other sights and I chose StreetSmart and I am so glad I did. I couldn't ask for a better product. The warranty is the best on the market and no upfront core charge was amazing. There was no hassle with shipping or on the core return.

Glenn Hansberry,1.0,"Not Perfect But Well Handled

I purchased a re-manufactured transmission for my 2010 Nissan Armada. I did my due diligence and felt it was the right option and right place to purchase my transmission from. The including of a new aluminum radiator addressing the known issues of nissans aluminum to plastic radiator and the failures that can lead to transmission issues had me convinced. I didn't have that failure mine was $2 worth of transmission line that blew. From time of purchase to delivery to Las Vegas from Tampa was only 5 days and was less than a days install at the shop. Easy swap said the mechanic and no programming needed. Then the hiccup. A few hundred miles in a shudder between 2nd and 3rd gears. At first I thought it was the roads and my horrific 20"" rock hard wheels. Sadly as time went on (approx 2 weeks) it got worse and worse. I called into Street Smart to put in a claim just in case and Street Smart wasn't playing around. They asked me to take it to repair shop at my earliest convenience which was still a week away. Once I did that they worked with my repair shop to decide what the next steps were. Within 24hrs of receiving what they needed from the repair shop they had a new transmission on its way to me. I understood when I bought the transmission they would help in the event of a failure with $50 per hour towards the shop rate and I was ok with that. Then I received an email from the tech. Since the failure happend so quickly we are upping the amount of reimbursement with a total dollar amount they will reimburse for the swap out. It was enough for mechanic to call us even. 5 days later the shop received the transmission and once again a easy swap. The next day it got put to the test a 1400 mile work trip over 3 days. Mountain Inclines and declines full pedal passing you name it smooth as silk every time. I was so happy I had my truck back. Hell, they were even efficient in reimbursing. In the end I am happy with everything even if the journey was bumpy for a bit. They did exactly what they said and more. I am confident that if anything else were to happen in the remaining 33 or so months of their warranty Street Smart will be right there diligent as ever to fix and back their product.

I am so happy with the service of Street Smart that I decided to write an updated review of how my car is doing.
The car is running great. I drove last week from Florida to Wisconsin. It was about 20 hrs of driving. Because I replaced the transmission, I was paying more attention to the RPMs that anything else. Well If you want a better example of how good this transmissions are, go ahead and drive it to California.
The RPMs were stable the whole time. If you have driven this route before, you know that it is not an easy route. 2100 rpm when stable in the road at about 80 MPH. Going up a hill, of course, the rpms go up and then normalized again. This is a CVT transmission in a 2014 nissan versa.

Bought a transmission a couple weeks ago. 1st transmission arrived on time (3days), installation was good. After that, we continue our trip and we made around 200 miles same day was installed, when we get our destination transmission starts to make a weird noise. The next two days we've been moving around, transmission runs but ocasionally 3rd and rear gear slip, the 2nd gear is always slipping at the beggining, specially when you need power on a sharp hill. That starts on Friday so I had 3 days and around 500 milles to test properly.
Monday I went to a garge, the owner contact SST and they decide to send a new unit to replace that one. I'm waiting for a week now for the second unit arrive here, it's been 2 weeks from the 1st one, we are travelling and time goes fast, stocked almost 2 weeks and scared about if the new one is gonna be better, besides it will cost us an extra 600$ dollars that we have to pay in advance and they will decide after if we get refund, we already spent more than 2 grant. New transmission supose to be here tomorrow, hope this one is better and they take care of all the new expenses.
We bought this transmission because the excellent reviews that we saw on trustpilot make us think it was the best option, hope to be more lucky with the new unit coming.

Matt Alston,1.0,"Long shipping time 2 stars, extension on core 5 stars

Based on the sales person's typical delivery and shipping times of 48 hours to ship and 4 days travel I gave the shop an expected arrival date of the transmission.

The order was placed on July 13th so the expected arrival was the 19th. With that they scheduled to install on July 21st.

I had not received the shipping notice by the 18th, so I called the shop and told them the I had no carrier tracking yet. I lost my place in the schedule since it was not confirmed to be there.

The transmission did not ship until July 20th, (7 days after order date) and I got the carriers delivery date of July 24th.

We are moving to Florida and everything was scheduled for the moving truck for July 29th and now without the car everything had to be rescheduled for that as well.

Once the transmission arrived on the 24th, I called the shop to see when they could schedule us in. They were booked solid through to the 4th of July holiday, and were going to be closed until the 8th.

After a heated call to the owner we finally got an appointment for the 2nd and 3rd and should be able to leave before the 4th of July holiday.


In your email about delivery it also stated that there was a 2 week window to schedule the core pickup. Based on not being able to get back on the shop schedule I was looking at not being able to get the car back until around the 12th and getting a large core charge on my account.

I called the core return number and was given a 2 week extension on the core date. That went very well thanks for that.


I do not understand why it took as long as it did to ship an in stock unit based on your normal shipping times.",US,2,2019-06-29T18:37:48Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Situation: 2007 Nissan Pathfinder with replaced radiator at used purchase. Fish Creek Nissan in Calgary, Canada replaced radiator with defective Rad. After ~ 110K Km rad ruptured as they do and trani was contaminated. Trani bench overhaul but needed new Valve Body (VB).
Action: Ordered rebuilt from Street Smart (SS). Received replacement VB on schedule. Proceeded to drop VB on install. Was helped a great deal by Steve and used 3 solenoids from defective VB to get dropped VB working properly. As in Canada I had to pay shipping of old VB back to Florida.
Result: SS refunded shipping costs and followed through on everything they said they would do. Truck has been running great and this is 2 months later.

This is a good company folks, trustworthy.

was a lot cheaper than getting one rebuilted and also it only took
2 days to from the time we received it until we were back on the

Quick delivery, transmission looked new and works great once installed! Jeep now has more power, doesn't struggle on hills, and shifts the way it should. I liked how Streetsmart handles the core charge. You don't have to pay the core fee up front, they give you 2 weeks to return the core and returning it was super easy. Just had to basically click a link in an email and print out the BIll of Lading and it gets picked up. Return shipping is already pre-paid. I only gave them 4 stars because they sent the wrong seal for the tail shaft adapter housing. I received the 2wd seal instead of the 4wd so I had to order the correct one. Other than the seal, it was a great experience. They even include more than enough premium ATF. I would recommend Streetsmart to anyone needing a tranny.

customer,0.6,"Delivery ok, Not Sure About Tranny Yet

Delivery was fine, unit looked good, return pickup was on time. Installation went as planned, but a vibration is now noted when in drive at low speeds and especially when in drive and the brakes are holding the van at a stop. Also, the starter sounds like it remains engaged about a second longer than it should when firing it up. Neither of these symptoms were present prior to the transmission swap on our 3.3 liter Dodge Grand Caravan. Haven't driven it 400 miles yet, but the other than the vibration at lower speeds (~25 MPH and below) and at stop, it seems to be shifting fine. Not certain if the new tranny is at fault for these issues or not, need to get it checked out (which will probably take diagnostic time and cost; it's just strange that they developed as soon as it was installed). One mechanic said drive it and see if it smooths out before bringing it back to the install shop, so I plan to put a few more mixed-driving miles on it first.",US,2,2019-06-09T22:23:31Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Received the transmission in three days. That was way better than I thought it would have been. Only had a few issues. The pan started leaking, I checked to make sure that all the bolts were tight. They were so I had to drain it and pulled the pan off to find out that some of the holes had been repaired and the inserts were proud of the serfice. I was able to fix the problem and resealed it. No more leak. Now I need to find out why my o/d light keeps flashing.

The only thing I suggest is updating the labor rates for the R&R. They are low. Toms automotive is a great place to have the work done here in Buena Park.

Charles Moore,1.0,"I purchased a transmission for a 98…

I purchased a transmission for a 98 Jeep Grand Cherokee on April 22nd, 2019 and had it shipped to Kansas City, Mo. The transmission's pump was defective out of the case. It had to be replaced.

UPDATE:
I initially reported that I was left on hold when I called the warranty desk for 30 and 45 minutes respectively. I later found out the beta version of a Voice Activated Hold Software I was testing had a technical malfunction and Street Smart was not a fault.

When I did get a warranty Rep I was told the transmission was about to ship. I wasn't kept apprised of the order status until today.

I had to rent a car to get to work for going on 2 weeks when it should've been 3 days. Furthermore, I'm having to pay an additional $200 in labor charges to re-install a transmission I never put a single mile on. Today is May 6th, 2019 and I was told the transmission will arrive on May 9th, 2019. That's will be 17 days after I place the order. I thought I was going to save $700 dollars by purchasing the transmission from Street Smart.

UPDATE:
I've since spoken to Street Smart. They apologized for the difficulties I experienced and they promised some assistance with the additional labor costs and rental car charges.

Overall View:
To be honest, this isn't the kind of take-charge response I expected. I was contacted within 24 hours of my complaint. Street Smart treated me with respect. They listened to the issues I had with my purchase and took action. Their professionalism and willingness to make things right were above and beyond expectation. In the world of online vendors where complaints go into a black-hole, this organization is a shining star.

Shawn Ogaz,1.0,"My doubts are gone.

I was a bit sketchy at first ordering a transmission from someplace I was unfamiliar with. I did a lot of research and read through a lot of reviews. After that I decided to give it a try, I requested a quote and the information was texted to my phone within minutes with a link to take me to the ordering page. I opted to call and place the order using the order number from the quote. Transmission was delivered in less than 48 hours with a new torque converter, tail housing output shaft seal, and full synthetic fluid change. I just swapped my tail housing to the new transmission, purchased new sensors from the local parts store and had the transmission back up and running in no time. They did not require a core charge or shipping to a
business address as long as they core pickup was scheduled within 2 weeks of delivery. Everything was quick and easy in this process. I couldn't be happier. And while I hope it doesn't come to this (Hopefully no more transmissions break on my other vehicles), I would gladly do business again.

customer,1.0,"Transmission Purchase/Warranty

I purchased a Street Smart transmission for my K2500 Suburban in November of 2018. From my research prior to purchase, this company appeared to build high quality transmissions and had an excellent warranty. This was exactly what I was looking for because I plan on keeping my Suburban for a long time!

Five months after it was installed, it began to shift erratically and getting progressively worse by the day. I immediately had the shop that installed it, look at it and was informed that I needed another transmission (not what I wanted to hear).

I then contacted the Street Smart Transmission warranty department. They then immediately contacted the installation shop and shipped out a new transmission. No hoops or hurdles to jump through. A true no hassle, no excuses warranty.

This speaks volumes about the type of company that Street Smart Transmissions is. My replacement transmission is shifting great and I can say with confidence (and now personal experience) that they stand behind their products! You can buy with confidence from this company, and can now say that I highly recommend them! A+",US,1,2019-04-22T02:06:13Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Great website, quick and timely response from company staff. 4 stars on delivery of product, actually got the trans one day sooner then expected.

Not too happy with a few things; 1) found the reman transmission had shift shaft that was very corroded and took extra effort to clean scale from shaft to allow shift module to be installed without damage. 2) Trans container was nice but not secured well and found shipper had removed (unhooked) two of the top cover hold down straps. Trans was not sitting in the carrier correctly causing concern for possible shipping damage.

WM,1.0,"Good deal

We build a lot of units in house, but on occasion, it's just more cost effective to get a crate unit for a customer.
This trans seems well built, good shift feel, no issues whatsoever.
Make absolutely sure you check any customer vehicles for an aftermarket tune, a cold air kit, or even an aftermarket air filter!
We reflash every GM vehicle when a trans repair is done back to a ""stock"" GM reflash.
A LOT more stuff is ""tuned"" than people realize....and a HUGE number of trans failures can be traced back to a bad tune.

My 2011 2500hd needed a transmission after 247k miles, I talked to two transmission shops that I personally know the owners, as I have been in the field for 35 years, both told me it would be about 3k to rebuild on the bench, meaning I would remove and install it. One suggested because of the miles, a better option would be to install a reman to which I agreed, I did a search on google and saw street smart, I visited their website, watched all the videos and read pages of reviews, I got a quote for a 6L90 that was $700. less then the rebuild and it included the oil. I had a few questions and talked to Nancy who was very helpful and made the purchase easier then ordering a pizza, my unit arrived days ahead of schedule and the core was picked up hours after I sent the request.I installed the unit and had the truck taken to the dealer for a reflash, I have driven the truck a couple hundred miles now and it drives like new again.

Got an price quote of $2,220.00 for the transmission, but found the same transmission for lower price and they price matched it. Was impressed with that. Was glad, too. Saved me some money.

Mike,1.0,"Wish I would have found Street Smart…

Wish I would have found Street Smart Transmission before I dumped 1,300.00 in my tranny because that's what the computer told my mechanic what to do. Don't waste your money by thinking you can repair your current tranny because the computer tells you so, SST is the top of its class by far, sent in my vin and within minutes had a quote, paid for it, arrived just like they stated, mechanic was very impressed with the tranny, said he never seen a rebuilt look so good and it came with the oil they want in it, put old tranny back in shipping container, printed off there e-mail / shipping papers and a truck showed up within 2 days to send my core back. This tranny also came with the best warranty on the market, and the total package is cheaper than what I could get at the dealership, again a much better warranty. After I spent 1,300.00 on a part that the computer said to replace on my tranny, the dealership had to flash it, the truck never did shift good I thought, it shifted hard, the dealership said that the tranny had to re learn how I drove and it would smooth out, hum, it locked up within 50 miles. Dealership said it was a freak thing, nothing they did nor the part had anything to do with it, I'm out 1,300.00 I find SST and we have the smoothest shifting truck again at a much lower cost than anywhere in the USA. Don't get me wrong it could go out tomorrow but something tells me that by the way they rebuild everything and its dyno tested before shipping that its going to last as long or possibly longer than the original tranny. Yes you are correct the warranty is only as good as the paper its printed on, something tells me SST will honor there warranty, again don't waste a dime on any part on your tranny that our fancy computers tell us to put on, you will be money ahead and rolling again if you use SST.",US,1,2019-01-29T19:33:57Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Unfortunately, due to the New year holiday my tranny was held at the delivery couriers terminal from Friday until Tuesday before I received it.

Everything was extremely easy. Ordering,delivery, and no upfront core charge saves a lot of hassle. By far one of the easiest transactions for a major online purchase. The only reason for a one star deduction was for the lack of information on returning the core. Arranging the pickup was extremely easy however. One you supply the information for the pickup at the repair shop the customer is left in the dark. I can only assume the pickup was complete as the customer gets no notice as to the BOL tracking number or even notice that the pickup was complete. If you get a surprise core charge on your account is guess you know it was not picked up.

They asked when I was going to install the unit an offered to ship me the correct fluid or I could purchase my own fluid an they would refund me the cost of the fluid .I chose the second option due to not wanting to wait for fluid , they refunded me as promised ! the transmission has been in for a couple of weeks now an no problems so far , would highly recommend this company , excellent customer service !!!",US,1,2019-01-04T01:39:21Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Even when emailing I stayed in contact with the same person and received always a response to questions or other needs within minutes or just a few hours! Great customer service on that part!


To the product. The shipment was amazing even though the return was quiet complicated due to a mess up on UPS side who never showed up to pick it up. This wasn’t streetsmart‘s faul it was fully ups but street smart still tried to be as helpful as possible. Once the products arrived and got installed it ran great. So far the product is performing amazing and I haven’t had any real trouble yet. I am just glad that the warranty is such a good one and that the customer service is very easy to communicate with.

A big thank you to Corey at streetsmart for getting me a great dealing everything since I did purchase a lot of parts at once! I do love as well that no core charge is required as long as a core is being returned within 14days. In my case I had trouble with the pickup and passed the deadline but the manager had fullest understanding and extended the timeframe for me.


As you can see that company does their very best to provide the very best product and service and therefore I am more then willing to forward their business to family and friends that might need them one day but as well would I always return as a customer! I am extremely satisfied with the product and company all over! I love how personal they are with their customers.",US,1,2018-12-31T14:51:26Z,Street Smart® Transmission

KP,1.0,"Positive experience...

After exhaustive research, I decided to go with a Re Manufactured transmission for my '99' Honda Accord 3.0L 2dr EX. Several local Honda mechanics advised not to buy used or rebuilt as this particular Honda had known issues regarding the OEM transmission.

I came across Street Smart's website and it is by far one of the most informed sites out there covering every aspect when replacing your transmission. Great customer service too. The ladies answering the 1-800 number were very helpful during the entire process.

Once I purchased, the shipment took a little longer than normal to get to the shop, I guess because of the Thanksgiving Holiday. Shout out to Powertrain in Mitchellville MD, who did the installation.

I'm now 1000 miles into Street Smart's re-manufactured transmission and let me just say, the car is running very smoothly. The Core pickup had a few hiccups relating to the carrier but, it finally reached the to the warehouse and the 3 yr warranty has been activated.

I Highly Recommend Street Smart Transmission!",US,1,2018-12-19T18:33:05Z,Street Smart® Transmission

I am happy to say that Streetsmart has stepped up and is taking care of this situation. They will cover anything over original quote. The gentleman I spoke to was very patient and understanding even when I was not. I really am sorry for my short and upset attitude but I want to thank streetsmart for taking care of everything. Fantastic customer service and if we needed another transmission we would come back and I would highly recommend. Suggestion for all, trust Streetsmart but communicate and be patient.

We purchased on Nov. 16th and went with the Street smart referred mechanic. We are still waiting for the completion of the car. We have had the run around on the phone because we refuse to pay extra or what was quoted because the 1st transmission sent had issues with the flashing. Why should we pay more because Street Smart sent a defective transmission. $75.00 an hour quoted now double that because the shop is working on transmission #2 and they are paid by the hour. No, don't purchase from them because its a bunch of BS guarantees. Looks good, sounds good but in the end they don't have your back when their product is bad. If we choose not to pay the mechanic we don't get out car back, If I get a lawyer its more money.

Transmission arrived when promised. I had it installed two weeks ago and just got back from a 300 mile trip. Everything seems to be fine. It does feel a little different shifting but probably because my old trans had 163000 miles on it and I was used to it. Before ordering I checked around with a couple of shops for prices to install it. Some of them only deal with certain trans rebuilders. I finally found an independent shop that charged me $720 for the labor and $160 for other incidentals $880 total. The total cost with the trans was $2360, far less than one quote I got of $2950 for a Jasper trans. I have to say I am very satified!!",US,5,2018-12-06T03:22:43Z,Street Smart® Transmission

I could not be more satisfied. The entire process was too simple to believe. The price for a remanufactured transmission was very fair to start with, then the free shipping to my mechanic's shop and the free pick-up and return of the old core was the icing on the cake. I was cautiously optimistic with the process in the beginning because it was so easy I was looking for the hidden catch (seemed too good to be true). The only ""catch"" is that I found a great American business that knows and provides customer service like no other. Now that I caught Street Smart Transmission, you can consider me a customer for life. (Hopefully, I won't need to call on you, but if any of my vehicles' transmissions fail me, I have the peace of mind knowing I don't have to shop around for quality service.) You're a breath of fresh air in today's ""who cares"" service environment. Who cares? Street Smart Transmission cares! That's who!

John James W.,1.0,"I ordered a transmission for my 03' PT…

I ordered a transmission for my 03' PT Cruiser Turbo and received it quickly. Only problem was that it was for an automatic. Was I angry? No. A bit disappointed, certainly.
I called customer service and the rep was very, very apologetic that I received the wrong transmission. When she checked on the manual transmission, and informed me that they did not re-manufacture the manual transmission, she actually felt badly about the whole situation.
So, what was the outcome? She immediately sent me the paperwork for the pickup with instructions, and filed for issuing a credit. This was on a Friday, and by Monday morning, the transmission was picked up. And by Tuesday morning, I had a full credit for the purchase on my card.
Now, I would have rather received the transmission, but instead, I received the best customer service experience I have had in years!
And when I need a transmission, guess where I am going? That's right, Street Smart Transmission. Smart business people know how to deliver an outstanding customer experience, and Street Smart Transmission certainly did that for me.",US,3,2018-11-13T22:49:59Z,Street Smart® Transmission

I am very unhappy with this purchase! Product is great, customer service is terrible. I had an issue after transmission was installed and had to bring it to the dealer to get programmed cause it wasn't shifting properly. Although the website said no dealer programming required. So I contacted company and explained. A guy named cory said the disc in the crate was for programming and the shop installing it should have known that. Well that wasn't clear to the shop nor did they have any software to support that cd rom. So dealer did it on my dime $150. Contacted cory and he agreed the website was confusing and he would get my money refunded for dealership charges. Sent him pictures of the invoices and nothing happened. That was 3 weeks ago and no contact or answer from anyone. Customer service gets an F. Hope I don't have to deal with them for any warranty issues!

Justin,0.8,"Wish it had gone better - UPDATED

-Order process was very smooth. Very efficient at getting the money.
-Transmission showed up 3 days later.
-Transmission installed and drove 8 miles before temperature climbed to 225 degrees and reverse went out.
-Warranty office was less than friendly.
-Clunky email system was not easy to communicate with them through.
-Warrantied transmission showed up 2.5 weeks later.
-Warrantied transmission works fine, but warranty payment for the labor took months to get to the servicing shop. Less than 1/2 of the submitted amount was paid, leaving me with a $400+ bill to pay for the balance of the labor.
-Not a pleasant experience, really. Warranty is touted as this awesome thing, but it's far from comprehensive and doesn't pay for as much as you think. Their Mitchell Book rate just isn't sufficient to cover the cost of what a quality shop needs to do the replacement work. Be careful. Maybe just stick with Jasper as they're more well known and easier to deal with in the event of a problem from what I understand. Wish I could give a glowing review...it's what I really wanted to do when I ordered from Street Smart.
UPDATE: Within hours of the initial review being posted, Corey with Street Smart reached out and conducted a very thorough review of my claim and comments. He then followed up less than 24 hours later and detailed his findings, apologized for the issues and delays I'd experienced, and issued an additional credit that covered the entirety of the remaining balance due. I am very happy with how he handled the comments and with this level of response and desire to do right by their customers.

Milton P.,0.8,"2005 Acura RL remanufactured transmission

Ordered a transmission for my 2005 Acura RL. Its been couple days and so far so good. They delivered the transmission to my shop of choice 1 day early. And the shop did not have any issues with installing the transmission aside from having to take some of the sensors (neutral safety switch, etc) from the old transmission as the remanufactured transmission did not come equipped with some. It came with transmission fluid, but not the Honda/Acura manufacturer fluid - rather it was an aftermarket equivalent, so the shop charged me extra for Honda/Acura transmission fluid. Other than that I am pretty happy with the product. I will post an update if anything changes.",US,1,2018-10-02T20:08:52Z,Street Smart® Transmission
Nestoa,1.0,"I have a 2005 Silverado with 170k

I have a 2005 Silverado with 170k. The 4L60E had started to surge from 1-2, float/""flair"" from 2-3 and limp into overdrive. It was time for an update. Buy a newer truck or keep investing into my paid off vehicle? I choose the latter because the truck was still in good shape and it was easier to pay off the repair than continue with another 60+/- months of payments. My local transmission shops estimated about $1,200 for a in-shop rebuild. After some research, I found that typically an in-house rebuild is cheaper but you can be subject to new problems if if the mechanic does not identify all the worn trans issues. There is also a longer turn-around time since they have to remove and dig into your exact transmission. After some more research, I went with Street Smart Transmissions based on the mileage warranty and reviews. This is my daily driver so I wanted a reliable product with the quickest turn around. I was hesitant about the warranty being separate from the install but the overlap of 50% coverage of labor cost, plus the amount of positive reviews swayed my decision. As advertised, the trans was delivered in 2-3 days ready for install (w/ fluid) and replaced. The shop boxed up the old trans for transport and it was taken 1-2 after scheduling for pick-up. Grand total was $2,500 ($1,500 trans/ $1,000 install). 1000+ miles so far, and the transmission is working as it should. Shifting is much better and I feel like I'm driving a reliable vehicle again. *Make sure your trans shop resets the ECM to relearn shift points... The replacement trans still surged from 1-2 after being replaced. I had to disconnect the battery cables for a few hours to clean the MAF sensor. This must have reset the system and now she shifts great again.
Any major repair should require the owner to research cost, product types, and reliability. This will ensure you make the right choice and get the right product. So far, I would defiantly recommend this company and their products. The staff was friendly with placing my order, and the process was simple.
-I cannot review if you need to make a claim under the warranty but I hope that they retain their high customer review rating, and will stand behind their products.",US,1,2018-10-02T16:08:48Z,Street Smart® Transmission

I purchased transmission for my 1997 F-350 7.3 the E4OD 4spd automatic. It arrived as scheduled. I had an ASI certified technician install it. It was not running right. It would shift erratically from 3rd to 4th and back to 3rd. I cleared the ""keep alive memory"" by clearing the computer control module with a Zueus diagnostic tool then the battery was disconnected for over 30 minutes. Upon re-connection and test driving the transmission performed as follows: Shift 1-2 normal, 2-3 normal(unless accelerator depressed aggressively-then jumps to 4th but jumps back to 3rd as soon as the accelerator is released)), 3-4 not normal, as accelerator is depressed trans jumps to overdrive and as soon as the accelerator is released it downshifts to 3rd and will not shift to fourth causing higher than normal revolutions of engine for that speed (50-65 mph) If the accelerator is depressed somewhat aggressively it jumps to overdrive but down shifts back to 3rd immediately upon letting off accelerator. I called Street Smart and tried to get some direction as to what the problem could be but they refused to discuss with me and said I need to take it to installer and have them call.",US,1,2018-09-25T02:35:38Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Street Smart delivered in 2 days after my order. The shop installed it the following work day by 12 noon. If you live in Los Angeles the shop was Gearheads Transmission in Van Nuys. The price was 630 and the boss there, Israel, was on top of every thing.
The transmission was installed in an 2004 Suburban 4x4 and it is working perfect. With the 3 year warranty I feel very confident should anything arise it will be taken care of quickly.
Returning the core was easy and quick, Israel drained the fluid as requested and packed it up into the container the new one was shipped in. Street Smart sent the truck to pick it up within 2 days.

Kurt Scha,0.8,"I believe they have a great service.

I believe they have a great product, service, and warranty for the money.
The purchase phase was easy. I supplied my VIN Vehicle identification Number so as to ensure that I received the correct model and version of the transmission as it was designed by the factory engineers. The transmission arrived in a purpose built shipping container, prepaid and delivered to the commercial location of my choosing. I sent it to my installation mechanic shop. They would even deliver it to my home address, although that costs a little extra.
So we removed the original transmission, put the StreetSmart remanufactured transmission on the workbench. Compared them side by side, all looked normal, and then swapped over things like hose barb fittings and sensors from the original transmission. The new transmission lifted into place and secured with bolts without a hitch. Then there was a problem. The torque converter bolts did not align properly. The new transmission had a stall converter and that misaligned bolt pattern is so that an incorrect transmission can not be connected to the incorrect engine. Not a match... Being the weekend, there was no one to answer the call on Saturday. I had budgeted for just 10 hours installation labor charges and this being a busy shop, the car could not stay at the facility more than the one day... A call on Monday to StreetSmart and they were wanting to make it right, figure out what went wrong and send what ever was required to correct the problem.
At that point, we had already reinstalled the broken transmission and moved the car, so I explained that I was unhappy and although I understand that mistakes happen, I just didn't want this or any transmission at this time. StreetSmart made arrangements with a shipping company for pickup, and after it arrived at their facility, they refunded my money. I really wish I had gotten the opportunity to drive their transmission. I wish I had my car complete after just one day as I had hoped for.... I wish I was writing this review with a five star rating.
Regardless of my outcome, StreetSmart is doing a good job and has a reputable company at their command. Trust this company to supply your transmission needs.",US,3,2018-08-24T16:10:05Z,Street Smart® Transmission

So I researched Street Smart Transmission they added a additional clutch disc, modified the bores internally great reviews!

Joe Starcevic,0.8,"Updated review

Took a few days more than quote said to ship, but had shipping expedited so it arrived on time so that was great. However, the Street Smart transmission starting having severe shifting problems after about 75 miles, so back to the shop. Called for warranty. They talked to mechanic and sent parts to replace on transmission rather than sending a replacement transmission. Said I'd have to pay labor differential. Doesn't seem fair when the thing was bad on arrival and could not be used, but I need the truck back so said go ahead. Mechanic opened transmission up to install replacement parts and says while the fluid is clear, it has a very strong burnt odor so he does not think the new parts alone are going to fix it. He called warranty people to tell them and find out whether they want to send a replacement transmission instead of installing the replacement parts and potentially having this one fail a second time. The warranty guy he's been dealing with is out until Friday and nobody there is willing to make the decision. Weeks of no vehicle and no end in sight!

Update 09/13/2018 - A replacement remanufactured transmission was provided under the warranty, so after a couple of weeks we were back on the road with it. Pulled camper to and from campground about 75 miles away with no issues so apparently this second one is going to last. The first one not making it very far cost us several nights of hotel since we had to turn around and pull the camper home when the first remanufactured transmission started acting up, but at least the warranty did result in full replacement.",US,2,2018-09-13T23:56:07Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Tim R,1.0,"When S*it Happens...

It's easy to give a great review when everything goes according to plan, but when the ""feces hits the rotating oscillator"" is when you know a companies heart and soul.
I ordered a remanufactured transmission from Street Smart on June 21st and had it delivered to a repair shop in Boone, NC on Friday, June 22nd, however, they couldn't do it until Tuesday the 26th.
They finished on Wednesday and when I asked them how it was running, they told me there was a hesitation shifting between gears! I told them that's not good and called Street Smart. They called the mechanic to go over some fine tuning the next day (the repair shop closed at 5).
When it was determined it was a bad tranny, SS promptly redelivered another one on Friday, June 29th. Of course, the repair shop couldn't reinstall it until Tuesday, July 3rd (I should have chosen a repair shop that wasn't so busy)
Street Smart not only warrantied the transmission and paid for the reinstall in full, but also covered my rental car from Friday until Tuesday, which they were under no obligation to do! (Maybe I shouldn't have told you that...lol)
It wasn't their fault it took so long, that was the repair shop's schedule, but they were great at trying to get this done as fast as possible.

Thanks to Corey, Jen, Victor, Mike and Char, great work, I really appreciate it!

Thanks again,

I could not have been more pleased with Street Smart Transmission. The stated details of the remanufacturing process, the 3-year unlimited mileage warranty, the hot/cold dyno testing, and the expedited exchange process convinced me to go with them.

I ALMOST paid a shop to more than this remanufactured transmission to rebuild mine. Thank God I found this website. Rebuilding transmission is as good as the person doing the job. Good analogy might be you pay Jane to clean your floors, she explains she is done, you pay her because they appear to be clean and look good. The next day Janis comes in and says you need your floors cleaned and you too notice that there is dust in the corners and some of the floor was not washed properly. It is all up to who you have rebuild the trani and how close to what you want they can do the job. Sometimes you never know and something just breaks or goes bad prematurely.

Regarding purchasing the transmission, this was pretty straight forward and painless. They got my order, processed it, and delivered as promised.

I'm a big ""J"" man but I'm swinging over to these folks. Never worked with them before BUT I never had to pick up a phone, everything was done online AND I ordered it Saturday night about 2:00am. My order was processed, card was charged within an hour and Tuesday 10:00am it's at my shop, it couldn't have been any better if they hand-delivered it! This is one awesome company. I watched the video, viewed them punching valve bodies out putting in sleeves adding updates - I mean you can't find better folks and if you can, it would take a micrometer to tell the difference. Excellent is excellent and these folks are it WITHOUT the obscene pricing others charge.",US,4,2018-06-04T22:22:08Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Henry Chen,0.8,"Good reply on my concerns about CVT Transmission

I was skeptical of this company at first. I order a remanufacture CVT transmission for my car and I looked all around the internet to find me a place that would give me a reasonable price. I called up the Nissan dealership but they are NOT willing to give me 3 year warranty on the transmission with parts and labor included. So after spending a long time looking I finally decided to go with Streetsmart Transmission since they are willing to give me a 3 year unlimited mile nationwide warranty with labor and CVT fluid included and price was reasonable. It make me feel secure knowing that my transmission is under 3 year warranty. I don't have to worry about it for 3 years. Corey was responsive with his emails. He answer all my questions and concerns. The transmission was shipped to the repair shop in 4 days once the order was place. I gave this review 4 stars is because there a hassle with the core return. I schedule for pickup but the shipping carrier keeps rescheduling the pickup. After the third request the company final came and pickup the core.",US,2,2018-05-27T02:33:53Z,Street Smart® Transmission

I recently purchased a 2006 Ford F150 5.4L truck with 118K miles on it and then drove it from California home to Arizona. Found out when I changed the tranny fluid that it had never had the fluid or filter changed. With the heat of the desert, things got bad real quick and I found myself only being able to make it one way to the tranny shop. Luckily I found Street Smart online and was amazed at the price and warranty terms. I ordered on a Friday morning and the tranny got there Monday afternoon. I was back on the road again the next day.

Doug Amburgey,0.8,"Cadillac 5L40E

Hoping I can change this rating in the future but as of now my experience has not been good. I ordered my transmission on 5/4 and my credit card was charged that same day. On 5/11 I still hadn't received any information about my order so I called, come to find out that customer service charged my card but never put in the order. I was then given a delivery date of 5/18 and a $75 credit for my trouble. On 5/16 I contacted customer service about why I had not received a shipment notice as it is at least 2 days shipping to Ohio; I was told that now they were pushing the order back to deliver on 5/23. It is now after 5pm on 5/21 and I have not received any shipment notifications so apparently they aren't going to meet their new arrival date either. Poorly run business that has trouble managing orders and understanding their production scheduling.

UPDATE 5/25/2018: Street Smart made the situation right. They acknowledged the issues with the order and offered me an additional discount and the transmission shipped on 5/23 and arrived at the installation shop on 5/24.

I'm going to give 2 reviews the first in this post and the second in about 6 months. I had the transmission installed about 200 miles back no complaints from the installers they said it went right together had all the components they needed and return of the old transmission was completely painless, I picked up the truck and took it out the shift points are smooth, subtle and appeared to be set to optimize the RPM with the engine, the transmission has continued to perform perfect within the 200 miles I have driven it, the driving conditions were around town and freeway, Flat ground and hills, currently there are no transmission leaks or puddles under where I park.

I put the street smart transmission in and then drove the truck 4,000 miles to the arctic circle in Alaska, not kidding! This could have been a perfect testimonial to their well built transmissions. If only this was the first transmission from them, but it wasn't. The first one lasted 22 miles before the truck was on a tow truck being taken back to the shop where I had to wait for a week and a half for the new one to come. I know human mistakes happen and even brand new parts can fail so I'm still giving a 4 star review. They clearly have the ability to make a decent transmission if you can drop it in and do what I did. Just wish it would have been on the first try.

All this aside, Street Smarts customer service department and warranty departments have been some of the best I've ever seen through out the entire process.

Thomas T.,0.6,"Buyer beware of limited 3rd party warranty coverage...

First transmission received had a component failure in the first 5 days. The 3rd party warranty company gave me a hard time stating that I would be required to again give up my vehicle so a shop could diagnose the issue before going any further. Keep in mind, this is a customer now being required to troubleshoot a new ""remanufactured"" transmission that is 5 days old. On top of that, do your research on the warranty as it hardly covers the labor cost for auto shops to diagnose issues. If this is the stance this company is going to take, they should offer to setup an appointment for the customer at a shop that has an agreed upon rate so the customer is not stuck trying to get work done at what most shops will tell you is an unreasonable rate. At the very least they could provide a list of approved auto repair facilities that adhere to their limited warranty coverage so that customers that just spent $2000 on a reman transmission and installation do not get stuck having to jump through all these extra hoops trying to negotiate a rate to fix a product that was faulty from the jump. After having to argue unnecessarily with a support rep at the 3rd party warranty company, they finally agreed to send a replacement transmission to have it swapped out which will also not arrive for another week! The experience thus far has been nothing like what the verbage on the Street Smart Transmission website would have you believe. If this is unacceptable practice then they should do their company a favor and find a warranty company that also lives up to the standard that Street Smart is trying to portray on their website. I can only hope that my experience thus far is the exception to the norm with Street Smart and hope my 2nd transmission operates as they have you believe it should. Otherwise I will never consider doing business with this company again and for sure could not recommend them.
UPDATE 5/2/2018: I have been in contact with the support staff from Street Smart which had worked to get a replacement transmission sent out to replace the initial unit which turned out to be faulty. The replacement was installed on 4/27/2018 at which the shop who had completed the work did state, ""this unit appeared to be in much better condition."" I am currently on day 5 of this second unit and so far so good. I will be certain to post updates with any changes.

Rami Robert,1.0,"Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them, smart enough to profit from them, and responsible enough to correct them

My problem was handled with utmost priority and responsibility
Honestly; I have never seen people standing behind their product like smart street transmission.
My case was still pending after two bad transmission were put on my Yukon Denali, then a third one, again it was leaking, I contacted the company again, this time top guys; Corey and Scott in Tampa, Florida were involved.
I received a phone call from them, they were outraged and very upset for what was happening, they felt my frustrating.
I felt honesty and sincerity in them, they were very concerned and they gave me a full assurance that they will take care of this problem no matter the cost to them.
These choice were at the table:
A full refund with labor cost for my transmission.
Take my SUV anywhere I please and they will pay the full bill for new transmission and labor.
Or let them handle it to find out where the problem is coming from, and they assured me that they will take care of this problem once and for all.
I picked the last choice because I really felt they were very sincere about their offers, and to my expectations they were.
I dropped my SUV at their Milwaukee Wisconsin Location (the company shop), and they provided me with a rental car for one full week, they kept my SUV for one week after installing a new transmission, drove it, tested it, then they called me to let me know that this time my SUV is fixed, and indeed it was.
Transmission is shifting beautifully and no leak at all.
Now is the big surprise; I received an email from Corey stating that the company will pay the labor in full for all faulty transmissions installed in my truck plus credited my account $550 for all the troubles I encountered, PLUS; he assured me that for the period of warranty (3 years) My transmission is fully covered labor and all, So I am worry free for three years.
Corey and Scott were always in touch with me throughout the whole process, assuring me that they will take care of this problem no matter the cost. they did what they promised.

The way these guys handled this problem really made me so ashamed for leaving a bad review.
I can't say enough to reverse the review. But I can say this; I will deal with this company again and again, because; they really stand behind their product.
I thank all the staff and technicians, I dealt with, They were very professional.
At the end, it was a happy ending for both. For me; my SUV is driving like a dream, for the company; they found out what the problem was and they corrected it. also they kept a customer for life (me).
Thank you again; words cannot express my appreciation for a problem well handled and beyond any expectation.

I ordered a 6l80 and received it 2days early. My mechanic installed it on a Friday and Saturday it would not go into gear until 2k rpms. Contacted customer support and explained what was going on. They agreed the tranny was the problem. Sent out a new one and it also arrived 2 days early. Installed on a Saturday and has worked like a champ. This is the only reason I gave it a four star rating. The staff was excellent at fixing the problem. As a mechanic myself I know anything electrical or mechanical can and will break this just broke a little sooner than expected (it happens).

Pros: Fast shipping. Good customer service.
Cons: Street Smart didn't actually remanufacture my transmission in their Florida factory. They ""sourced"" it from another shop.
While it would have been nice to have known ahead of time that my transmission would be from another reman shop it still has the same warranty and Street Smart says it's just as good. My mechanic said the transmission looked great. Nice attention to detail. The transmission itself feels tight for lack of a better word. It's shifting ok. No slippage to speak of. Probably just needs to be broken in a bit. Apparently the computer has to adjust to the new transmission for a short while on the Nissans. The owner himself addressed the concerns I had. He's a good guy.

Blake Koeppe,1.0,"My Shop Said New Transmission...Street Smart Saved the Day

My shop said its time for a new transmission. With Scott from Street Smart's knowledge, we were able to determine it was only a defective valve body. Throughout the process, he was a resource I consulted and he quickly got me past my sticking points. A new transmission would've cost 4x what the valve body did.


The valve body itself was remanufactured per Sonnax's specs. The deciding factor to go with Street Smart was they replaced wear parts proactively, instead of simply 'inspecting' them, as other places I researched prefer to do. Even if Street Smart isn't the least expensive option initially, they will be over the long haul...meaning you won't pay labor rates twice when a lesser remanufacturer's part fails.",US,1,2018-02-02T20:47:51Z,Street Smart® Transmission

My SUV went into limp mode while driving in a highway. It was towed back to the professional installer. I was told by the installer to call the transmission company. I did call and the warranty department wrote my problems and stated a technician will call the installer and they will inform me of the process. 4 days pass mo technician called the installer company nor there is a follow up with me. Its a shame with this good Company. They were so nice when processing your purchase and the delivery of the transmission is so fast. Pick up the core too was so fast. No hassle at all. There customer service is so nice, understanding, and very helpful. A perfect company? Not till you run into trouble with transmission. You are alone and in the dark. No follow up, no outreached. That’s there warranty department.. Needs fixing. I will still buy transmission from them. There stuff are in good quality. It turn out that it was not the new transmission which caused the limp mode.

When looking online for a rebuilt transmission, I was impressed with Street Smart.

The online reviews certainly looked good as well. My transmission has been in for a couple of weeks now and is working great - no issues whatsoever.

customerLe,0.6,"Owner to the rescue!

Everything from the ordering to delivery went excellent. The truck is at the shop and as far as I know the tranny should be replaced. I left town right after dropping off the truck and haven't been back to pick it up so my review will have to basically stop here. Would of like to wait and do the review after picking up and driving the truck but this is the third email I've received wanting a review. Hoping for the best when I get the truck.

UPDATE!!!
The transmission was leaking so contacted street smart they sent it to warranty. They told us to have the installers look at it, at a quick look with out taking it apart... where the fluid was coming from they thought it could possibly be the pump seal. So they told them to go ahead and take it apart and fix it. Well when they got it apart it was not the seal it was something else, not sure what but enough that street smart is sending another transmission. So much for a quality refurbished and tested transmission. Also if it cost the same to remove and replace this one as it did the first time around they are not covering that amount by quite a lot, and then there's another week plus without the truck while waiting for the next transmission to arrive and get installed. This is turning out to NOT be a very pleasant or enjoyable transaction. NOT A HAPPY CAMPER!

Update: 5/29/18
Just received a call from the owner it sounds like there may have been communication issues where he was not copied on emails between myself and his staff. He assured me if he had been involved which he usually is, things would have went differently. With that being said he has reimbursed me the full amount of the cost to remove and replace the tranny the second time around. After our phone conversation if you're having any issues with your transaction I would suggest you ask for the owner, he seems to be an upstanding business owner.

Bought my rebuilt 05 mustang GT transmission from Street Smart Transmission web site. The web Site is quite detailed and prompts you for all the information needed to insure you receive the correct transmission for your vehicle (in my case Ford 5R55S). It was convenient to be able to have the order shipped to my repair shop, also to have the old transmission picked up there as well. During the course of ordering I had some questions that were immediate answered via emails. My experience has been exceptional.

feifei youngling,1.0,"Transmission defective, company immediately replaced with professionalism (UPDATED)

Transmission cracked, leaks fluid, unusable: I bought a used 6F50 transmission from Street Smart Transmission in July 2017, paying a lot of money ($1,500+) for the remanufactured item. The mechanic charged labor of more than $ 1,000 to swap out the old transmission and put in the new remanufactured transmission from Street Smart Transmission. I picked up the vehicle from the mechanic shop and when I reached home, I noticed the vehicle was leaking (red) transmission fluid. The shop said to bring it back for an examination, and they discovered that the transmission was cracked in a spot where there was an obvious bad weld. The shop said the fluid was leaking from this weld, and that it is a problem that must be fixed or the transmission would continue to leak fluid. This means that I will have to pay the mechanic another $ 1,000 to swap out the transmission again. Would you be happy to hear that news? Would you recommend Street Smart Transmission to others? Would you buy from Street Smart Transmission if you were buying for the first time? I will reach out to Street Smart Transmission when their phones open on the weekdays (today is Saturday), and I will further share my future experiences with the company here, and possibly with the BBB and other online review sites. Although the transmission drives well so far, it is unacceptable that it is leaking transmission fluid up to a 1/4 quart per day. I will reach out to Street Smart Transmission to see what they will do before I take further action. Thank you.

UPDATE ABOUT ONE WEEK LATER (August 7, 2017)
Street Smart Transmission reached out to me and the shop on the following Monday (they are closed on the weekends) and immediately offered to ship a replacement transmission to replace the first transmission which had the leak. The company should be praised for their swift action to address the issue. This level of service is very noteworthy and demonstrates that the company cares about their customers. My mechanic received the transmission within a week, installed the new transmission, and so far the vehicle drives well. Although my mechanic did have to charge labor to replace the defective transmission with the latest transmission, Street Smart Transmission said they could possibly reimburse me a portion of the labor costs, which is dependent on their final examination of the defective transmission and the labor costs. I have since updated my rating from one star to three stars. I am currently awaiting the completion of that process and will post an additional updated review and rating to reflect the latest outcome.

UPDATE ABOUT THREE WEEKS LATER (August 25, 2017)
I submitted my final repair bill for the second time my mechanic worked on my vehicle to install the second transmission (replacing the first defective transmission) and Street Smart Transmission followed through by reimbursing me on the majority of the repair costs, actually reimbursing me a higher dollar amount than their original estimate of the reimbursement. I have to say I am satisfied with the overall reimbursement and the second transmission works well so far. I think the biggest concern a customer has when buying a remanufactured transmission online is: will the transmission work and will the company help if there are any problems. It is a leap of faith for anybody to spend thousands on an item sight unseen and so a transmission company that can soothe those fears and show a good reputation will do well. I speak only of my experience in that Street Smart Transmission did immediately seek to provide a replacement transmission for the original defective part, covered substantially the repair costs on the second transmission swap, and their customer service was very responsible and helpful in guiding me through the process, even providing reminder messages prompting my action and response. I would hope that Street Smart Transmission has learned from this experience so they can avoid such a repeat incident with future customers, perhaps the defect is the fault of the company or perhaps it was undetectable defect inherent in the transmission...their engineers can determine that. Nonetheless, I would say that I feel comfortable buying another transmission from the company given their demonstrated commitment to taking care of their customers. it is said that in business a customer is not really a customer until they are a repeat customer.

I had ordered a transmission from the street smart company over the phone and was blown away with the customer care that was provided. I didnt have to repeat myself half a million times to get my order through. I recieved my transmission in about 5 or 6 days. I intalled the trans and put the correct fluid in. After i installed the trans, i kept hearing a noise from under my 95 GMC Sierra 3/4 ton truck. My truck sounded like a school bus taking off. I called them back and asked if this was normal and if the sound would go away after a break in period. They informed me that was not normal and every once in a blue moon a trans will slip through quality check
unfortunately i recieved one. They put a rush on a replacement trans and i had it in 3 days. I am very, very, very satisfied with this companys work and customer care.

Finally a company that is trustworthy and are exactly what their website states. They do what they tell you they will do and are super friendly and knowledgeable. If you have a question they will find an answer for you and stand behind the information they provide. My mechanic has told me twice since install that that was the best transmission he has ever installed. It came with everything needed to install it. He didn't have to go to local parts store to get anything. He wants to become an installer for them. I have already referred 4 people to Street Smart Transmissions.

The Transmission just turned 14K miles since Installation. I have had Extremely Heavy loads on the Flatbed it is installed in, and it has done an outstanding job.

The trans in the Blazer had no 3rd or 4th gear. Tried replacing the solenoids, but still no good. So, shopped all over and online for a replacement. After reading the reviews for other transmissions I went with Street Smart Trans. Received a quote really quickly. Price was about the same/better than the competition. I went on their website and Trustpilot for research. Seemed good, hence ordering from SST. Trans was shipped as promised on the date promised to the shop. Shop installed and I got the Blazer back two days later. The shop said they would not ship the core back until I drove around for a day or two to verify the fix. Trans works well. I scheduled a core pick up and they picked up as scheduled. Everything went smoothly with SST. Price was better or as good as any other.

She's Runnin' Now,0.8,"Arrived when they said, but was defective.

Street Smart Transmissons was easy to work with and the tech dept. was knowledgeable and worked to make everything right. Unfortunately, the transmission they sent started out on the wrong foot. There was a TSB from Ford that showed a forward speed sensor was eliminated in later years so the casing for the transmission they sent had nowhere to mount the sensor that came out of my old transmission. Good thing there was that TSB from Ford dated September 29, 1997 on how to remedy this situation. Once the trasmission was installed; however, it would not go into reverse. The shop tried everything the tech told them to try to no avail until they finally noticed there was fluid leaking around the reverse servo. Further investigation noted that the circlip was not seated properly. The shop removed and re-installed the servo and circlip and everything appears to be working fine, with me covering the extra labor cost to fix the problem. At least I didn't have to wait a week for them to send a whole new transmission. Seems to me that if they dyno tested each transmission for 30 minutes as they say then they would have caught a transmission that wouldn't go into reverse from the get-go though. It's up and running now with no residual problems after installation. Hopefully it'll last another 234K miles like the original one. 2/6 Well one thing I can say about Street Smart Transmission is customer service is #1!. They refunded my cost to have the repair cost and worked with auto shop to repair the defect. I believe they would have shipped a new transmission no questions asked if they couldn't have figured out the problem. I've given them an extra star and wouldn't hesitate to try them again. I guess anyone can have an accidental problem slip through, it's how you deal with it afterward that makes the difference.

Steve E.,0.8,"So far, so good.

I have only put about 1000 miles on the replacement transmission (Ford E4OD) but it has performed well so far. I expect that it will continue in this regard for many years and miles to come.

Pros: Call them or send them an email and they will answer you.
They have a good reputation and my experience supports it.
The transmission arrived in a plastic crate that fully covered the contents and provided an easy method to return the core.
The price was less than a local shop wanted for a rebuild, and the warranty was better.
Shipping both ways was included in the price.

Cons: Only one, you need to plan on sending your core back to them quickly. When I removed my original transmission there were other issues that I needed to address. Since I was only working on this project on the weekends I needed an extra couple of weeks to get it all back together. I also wanted to keep my original until the replacement had proven itself for a week or two. I was told that keeping the core too long would affect the warranty of my replacement unit. Though I have been pleased with the replacement (and ultimately didn't need to worry about it) I would've liked that extra time to keep my core nearby until I was ready to send it back. Mind you I'm not talking months here, only a few extra weeks.

That said, my overall experience was very satisfactory. I would buy from SST again and will recommend them if the opportunity arises.",US,1,2017-01-24T16:33:41Z,Street Smart® Transmission

I was a little unsure that a company would really operate as advertised. But, I need a transmission for my Pathfinder and Street Smart seemed to be my best option. What l found out through every step of the process is that this company operates exactly how their web site and videos claim. It was an extremely easy process. They delivered the transmission and radiator to my house and the driver took the delivery off the truck and set it down at my garage door. After I completed the install I called Street Smart and the core exchange was set up and just like that the core was gone and I had my pathfinder back on the road with a new radiator and refurbished transmission with no hidden surprises. The only reason that I rated 4 stars instead of 5 is that the transmission and radiator have only been in the Pathfinder for a couple weeks. However, as long as it keeps working the way it has been, which is flawless, I would change the review to 5 star. Only time will tell.",US,1,2017-01-22T17:10:20Z,Street Smart® Transmission

although this was my 5th attempt to get a working right transmission (3 by the same guy)street smarts is the best so far the vibration that company x said was my wheels went away (same wheels) and it runs cool shifting leaves some tweaking needed as it hesitates too long between first to second and in other shifts also but they are not every time overal its the best one since factory which went down at 75000 mile but it was 40 days out of the 5 year warranty they would not honor it",US,1,2017-01-12T15:33:52Z,Street Smart® Transmission

I ordered my Transmission at about 2:00 p.m. and it was delivered the very next day. I was astounded. Next was the unpacking, it was packaged very well, however there was no printed documentation with the transmission. Now this was not a big problem, because emails were sent to me including 800 numbers and contact numbers for the company and the tech line to answer any questions. The only issue was the shop installing did not have these emails, I did, so I got a call from the shop, and then had to pull up the emails and give that info to the shop. So the install went well, and on my first highway test drive a trip of about 55 miles each way, the truck ran fine. The second trip the truck also ran fine, however died on me when in motion making a relatively low speed turn. I completed the turn and then put the truck in Neutral and started it right back up. Later in the day I started the truck, put it in Reverse to back up and it died, again restarting immediately. Now an issue with the engine dying is not necessarily transmission related, but many times it is with diesels, and this truck has NEVER died before in the entire time I have owned it. So it has been less than 2 weeks since the install so we shall see how happy I am as time goes on.",US,1,2017-01-06T15:55:32Z,Street Smart® Transmission

I was skeptical at first and actually found another transmission for a few hundred less but the warranty was garbage and it was not remanufactured so I went with street smart instead. Shipping was Fast, Free, NO up-front Core Charge, and came with 3 year unlimited mile warranty! After I installed the transmission I drove about 200 miles with about 30 of those mile in stop and go city traffic, then loaded my truck with about 600lbs and drove 1200 miles home with no problems!!!!!

Brad Heizer,0.6,"4L60E shipping nightmare

This order started off with me going online and getting a quote through their website. Everything seemed good and I wanted to order it but wanted to speak to someone in person to order it. I called and confirmed the quote and told them I wanted to place an order. Was told that someone from the shipping department would call me right back. No call back that day, so I went ahead and placed the order online. A couple of days later I received the tracking information for the order and found that based on the B.O.L. that they listed they Shipped the wrong transmission, even though the order confirmation stated the correct vehicle information with the exception of the VIN number was from a completely different vehicle. I immediately called customer service and spoke to a lady who was extremely helpful and assured me that the correct transmission would ship out that day (Wednesday). I called back the following day since it was a 1 day ship point to get a tracking number and was given the run around and told they would call me back with it. Waited until Friday and called back again to get the run around again stating that they would get it and call me back. Every time I called was told someone from the shipping department would call me back. Finally received a call back stating the transmission was being shipped by another carrier and that I would receive the tracking info soon.

I finally received the correct transmission on Tuesday of the following week. The original transmission was supposed to be delivered the Wednesday previous. The vehicle was torn down on that Wednesday and tied up the shop for almost an entire week while the customer had to utilize another vehicle and me explaining each day that the transmission should be here tomorrow. Street Smart did credit me back $150 for the hassle, which is not much when you have to put up with this much hassle and aggravation.

The transmission does work properly and have not had any issues with it so far, but customer service, shipping department and Cory need to get their stuff together and learn to follow up and return phone calls.

Pete,1.0,"Prompt courteous service with quality product and peace of mind!

I took my 2006 Mazda 6 to a local mechanic who wanted $400 to tear down the transmission to see what was wrong with it. If it needed a rebuild it would be over $2,000 and the $400 would go to the cost. That would be a one year warranty. I asked how much for a three-year warranty and he said that it would be over $6,000. I did not like my options and it seemed really open-ended with me taking all of the risk. I found Street Smart Transmission online. I really liked the educational tools. I liked the idea of a re-manufactured transmission and a three-year, transferable warranty. I had a bit of a time finding a local mechanic who would do the replacement. Most admitted that they make money by marking up the transmissions. In the end, however, I did find three that were willing to do it and I got quotes from each. I ended up paying about $2,250 for the new trans mission and fluid and about $650 for mechanic to do the replacement. I am very pleased with the outcome all around. We had a bit of an issue with FedEx refusing to take the core for some unknown reason, but Street Smart promptly sent another courier to pick it up.

Matt,0.6,"""UPDATED"" Defective transmission

""This was a 1 star review but has been updated per the updated details below below."" So this review has should have 2 stars simply because I did get a Transmission that works after the warranty claim. Here is where the problem began. I ordered a tranny for an 05 frontier 4x4. Due to the vast majority of contamination issue with Nissan they sent a new radiator as well. Product took longer than expect to arrive to the repair shop but that wasn't an issue, more of a nuisance. The trans and radiator were removed the system was flushed and the rubber hoses were replaced. After install of all new components there was an immediate shudder shifting into 2nd gear. Only shifting into 2nd was there a problem all other gears were smooth.The shop calls the warranty department to ask how to proceed. Shop was instructed to do a band adjustment and add friction modifier but the shudder remained. The warranty department shipped a new unit that arrived very fast but I was stuck with paying the removal and replacement again. The reason for the negative review was the warranty process. They claim they will pay the $50 per book hour to replace and did kick in an extra $50 for fluid but that wont cover the install (still waiting to see that check) and I feel I was shipped a bad transmission as the problem occurred immediately and had about 20 total miles ran on it to try to fix the issue to no avail. The transmission shop agreed that it was a faulty unit. I called the claims department several times to try to get covered for the full cost of the unnecessary 2nd removal and replacement but they claimed the faulty transmission had to be tested to see why it was defective. Guess what? they do this test in house and claim the transmission contained a high level of glycol. How? Strange as it was a new trans and radiator and the system was flushed and hoses replaced. Also the replacement transmission they sent was installed and shifts flawlessly from the moment it was test drove. They claim to only have a 3% defective rate as the units are dyno tested. I feel I was in that 3% and that the warranty department failed to own up to sending a defective transmission because I was requesting the full amount to be reimbursed. I would say feel free to try your luck as I did get a working transmission. But buyer beware if you happen to fall within that 3% that fail.... Warranty staff was rude and couldn't care less. ------ Update---- I was contacted by Corey with Street Smart Transmissions. We had a nice telephone conversation and what I can tell you is he was very kind and concerned with my issue of the trans being faulty from the start. He has made things right with me and went over and beyond what the strict warranty department would have done. ( the warranty department appears to be a different company serving multiple remanufacturers' and shouldn't be a reflection of the nice people at Street Smart) Corey corrected my concerns and is trying to create a no-hassle situation if and when the product has problems out of the box. Cant thank you enough Corey for contacting me and understanding my concern.",US,1,2016-11-08T21:50:20Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Charles F. Marofske III,1.0,"Quality Product, Reasonable Cost and Excellent Warrantee

Transmission was purchased online and delivered(free of charge) to my mechanics shop error and hassle free. Unit physically looks brand new and to date has about 100 miles of trouble free driving. Good solid hard shifts in the low gears, although as a performance enthusiast I would have liked an even firmer 2/3 shifts too, especially because this is a problem trans for GM. In 2 GM cars with the same motor/trans I have burned through 6(?) transmissions(2 factory and at least 3 OEM maybe 4 rebuilds, as I don't recall if I went back to Aamco twice or not). Both the factory and OEM rebuilds regularly failed around 50-60K. This is the reason why I purchased from Street Smart. They claim to beef up the weak points in their rebuilds and they have a no cost, no strings attached warrantee which even covers mechanics labor, if necessary.

Street Smart processed my wifes credit card sent her the confirmation and 3 days later the transmission was delivered to our drive way. I installed the replacement transmission into the car. Placed the old transmission back into the shipping container followed the easy online instructions provided by Street Smart in the email they sent and made the arrangement for pick up. On the second day after making the pick-up arrangement for our core transmission the carrier showed up to our driveway we signed the paper work everyone had their copies.

It was easy to order from Street Smart. The only downside was that it was delivered 2 days early.

You see, I have a farm and work night shift as well. I had woken up to do my normal chores and had returned inside to shower and get ready for work. There was a knock on my door AS I WAS GETTING IN THE SHOWER. I peered out the front bedroom window and saw a semi trailer. I wasn't expecting it's delivery until Wednesday! Here it was, Monday, and they were ready to unload it! I ran to the front door, yelling at my dogs to get back and opened the door. It was then I remembered I was completely naked! Thankfully the driver didn't get a full view and ditch my transmission in the yard as he rolled out of town.

Installation was a breeze. Everything looks great, except the pan. It was somewhat dinged, dented, and has paint peeling off. But I'm not going to knock any stars for that since it was delivered so fast.

I now have 4,000 miles on my rebuilt transmission - and that's a great start. I would prefer to write a review about a transmission with 104,000 miles on it but that might take a few years. A very reasonable price for both a transmission and radiator with very fast shipping - I had the transmission in three days from purchase (I was expecting weeks). It was a perfect fit and my mechanic praised the build, fit, and finish of the transmission. Once installed, my rebuilt transmission reminded me of how pleasurable my car had been to drive several years ago. Ultimately, it's only a great transmission if it's still performing flawlessly after 100,000 miles but I give it very high marks for an excellent beginning.",US,1,2016-08-30T02:14:41Z,Street Smart® Transmission
John B,0.6,"Rough first experience

I run a newer repair shop and have been looking for a good/reputable remanufactured transmission source. StreetSmart seemed to have good reviews and their website seemed to function well. My first transmission order was a 1993 E40D 2wd unit. I received my confirmation via email and also some light correspondence with Corey (sales manager?). This transmission shipped one day late and was lost in shipment (Fed-ex). I received it 3 days later than I had originally hoped. The build took longer than expected and I understand mistakes are made by everyone. The box was a generic black transmission box rather than application specific so the transmission spent the whole trip riding on the oil pan (several small dents in the pan that could have resulted from this or been there before...) There was fluid on top of the transmission and paint peeling off of the pan from soaking in fluid. When I attempted to transfer the tail housing from my old transmission to this new unit, the included kit was not correct. Both my bushing and output shaft seal were too large. A call to StreetSmart, and I hopefully have correct parts being over-nighted to me. I have not had the opportunity to even run the truck yet to tell you if functions are as expected. I have a second transmission on order for another truck (again an E40D 2wd) and it was shipped via a second carrier (R&L) on 8/26 and I'm being told by R&L that I won't see it until 9/7... not feeling very excited about the situation, especially when their website states 1-3 day shipping.

So far so good, transmission shifts well and appeared well built and very clean, shipping was quick.
The only improvement that I would suggest would be a better installation kit for the tranny cooler that came with it, there were no instructions whatsoever and no fittings for the hoses. I had to go find the proper sizes and Come up with my own mounting fabrication. The other thing would be installation checklist like what had already been done and what we needed to do, I.E. wether the torque converter was filled and ready or not.
Both of these are very minor to me and they do have a good tech support hotline so everything was easily taken care of and for the price and warranty of the transmission I have no real complaint I put the trany in on 5 August and already have 1000 miles on it 8 August and all is good.",US,1,2016-08-08T22:19:08Z,Street Smart® Transmission

I heard a ton of stories, how this shop is better than others and how the internet will only rip you off.... However I choose to take a chance with Street Smart based on their warranty, cost, dyno testing and several candid conversations which all helped build my trust. The whole experience was a 5 out of 5, however even with my ratings I would have liked follow up e-mails as to when the trans physically shipped and arrived. I also expected the replacement trans to come 'painted pretty'... but paint doesn't make the wheels go round and round, and out of the box the unit was clean and into the truck all went very smooth and the trans seems to drive as expected. Time will tell, I only have 50 miles on the trans but don't expect any problems. I highly recommend you give these folks a try",US,1,2016-07-21T01:53:39Z,Street Smart® Transmission

J. Burks,0.2,"Do not buy.

Do not buy from this seller. I bought a 6l90, had a shop install it for 900$, and it leaked from the bell housing cover upon first test with zero miles, so this transmission must have skipped the Dyno test or it would have been caught then. Warranty sent a new transmission but it only covered half the cost of another labor bill of 900$. I could understand if this transmission would have leaked even a month later but it didn't. It leaked upon installing fluid and zero miles so it was sent to me faulty and I had to pay for two installs only getting 440$ refunded. Not fair, not dyno tested, do not buy from this seller ::: Update::: I was credited 160$ of the 250$ top of the line synthetic transmission fluid I was out. This was very stand up of Cory at street smart and I really can't say anything bad about him as person. He has been very cooperative but in the end I'm still out 90$ for fluid on first install and 440$ out on second labor install for a total of 530$. This company has excellent reviews as why I chose them so I guess it's just how my luck goes. This review is just to inform you that they do make mistakes and they do hold up to their warranty but in the end at least one customer got dealt an unfortunate hand",US,1,2016-08-02T17:45:48Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Transmission delivered 2 days earlier than promised. At least $800 cheaper than price quoted from several auto service centers, $1500 cheaper than from Chevy dealer. Because of the upgraded/aftermarket parts, I expect this transmission to last better than the original. My Uplander is running smooth and ready for the next 150K miles! When I talked to the receptionist at the auto service center she said they don't install customer supplied parts (sniff, frown). Talked to the manager, more than happy to do the work. Word to the wise, pick an auto shop that tells you they need to flush the radiator if you have a transmission cooler, $100 more but worth a quality install.

Douglas McClain customer,1.0,"awesome product with great customer service

I have been in the automotive repair business since 1963. This is the best warranty hands down i have ever seen on an automatic rebuild. The last rebuild for 2200 on my 2003 silverado SS by a local high end shop was never right from the get go and a trip back to the shop after the 1 year 12k mile warranty expired got me another 240 dollar charge but it still wasn't right . Being quite the skeptic on all things being repaired i was worried about doing business on the internet. After reading all the reviews and pouring over there websight and reading all the positive reviews on the forum i frequent i ordered ,it arrived early the core was picked up as promised. But the best part is right out of the box this transmission preformed flawlessly perfect crisp up shifts and smooth downshifting on deceleration. I could not be more pleased and the peace of mind a great warranty gives you is hard to measure. I applaud your company and wish you much success. and as my dad used to say ( you're never sorry when you buy the best)

I recently purchased an older car to use as a station car. The car was clean and only had 63,000 miles on it.....hence why i bought it! I thought everything was fine until the trans started slipping....within two days. They must have put some additive in so it wouldnt slip right away. Since i purchased it with no warranty i was stuck with a bad trans. Everything else was ok so i figured what the heck i'll look for a trans. I talked to a couple rebuilders and i felt they were all giving me the runaround. Then i callrd Street Smart and spoke to Cory....who was very knowledgeable and extremely helpful. His price was great and his warranty is second to none. They shipped the transmission in two days, i had aamco install it for a resonable price....and the transmission is like brand new.

CHARLES rEDWINE,1.0,"Outstanding overall service

Requested a quote on their website and withing a few minutes got an email reply asking for my vin # so as to more accurately match the transmission to my vehicle. Probably within the hour I received a complete quotation for the transmission with no cost delivery and pick up of the core. Another plus was that the core charge is waved for 30 days so I don't have to worry with the core charge. The warranty is 3 years unlimited mileage. The trans was delivered to the door one day earlier than their estimate and I was kept informed every step along the way by email. I hope I never have to replace another transmission in one of my other vehicles but, if I do I know who I will call!",US,1,2016-02-12T21:22:25Z,Street Smart® Transmission

Tom Baxley,1.0,"Perfect Sales Experience

Your video sold me on the ""who to buy from"". But are you as good as your video? Yes you are. Shipped the transmission as promised. The wrong radiator was shipped which could have cost me a lot of time. In stead you sent me the right radiator 3000 miles OVERNIGHT. Service doesn't get any better than that. No long discussions, no ship it back and we will send the right one. It is a little early to tell though it seems the transmission is as good as the original factory transmission.

A Tampa Customer,1.0,"Fansastic, hassle-free, professional experience.

Needed a properly rebuilt, updated, and warrantied transmission; did my research and found Street Smart Transmission to be the easiest, fastest, most reliable company to do business with. Went online, entered my VIN, got an email next business morning... called and immediately spoke with two folks that treated me right. Paid over the phone and the unit was shipped next day to my shop. Two weeks thus far and the transmission is still flawless. Core return is a very easy process when shipping to your shop.

To begin with, my on-line experience was quick and painless. From the quote to the purchase, everything was easier done than said. And then the delivery to my prefered shop arrived a day early.

Roger,1.0,"A very wise choice to trust Street Smart Transmissions!

I researched for a decent price for a reliable replacement transmission for my Ford Sport Trac. I found many were available but no one could compete with the price, shipping, warranty and customer service policies this seller has. I saved nearly half the cost locals charge even after I hired a professional to install a transmission he didn't sell to me.

The buying and Shipping experience was easy. Bought online with my card, it was immediately shipped to my mechanics garage. No core charge, threw the old transmission in the awesome shipping container, slapped on the return label. It was just that easy!!!!

Have 10,000 miles on the transmission. Was shifting rough, then I changed the bad ""Speed Sensor"" (Should have changed it when they installed the tranny). It now shifts better than the stock transmission ever did!!! Runs great, no leaks, no problems!!

Kathy,1.0,"Absolute top rate customer service!

I called Street Smart about a reman transmission for my 2003 Acura MDX. After talking to Corey, their sales specialist, I felt confident that I didn't have to call anyone else. The first transmission arrived as scheduled - right to the door of the shop. There was an issue, however, and the torque converter did not spin freely. I called Street Smart, they put their tech on the phone with our tech, and soon it was determined that there was a defect in the torque converter. Less than a week later, a second transmission arrived (both were shipped free - one price - no haggling)! Street Smart did not want us to ship the first unit back until the car was back on the road running normally. They were AWESOME to work with, the prices were comparable to similar units, and NO SHIPPING COSTS. They arranged to pick up the faulty unit too, at no cost. I would highly recommend this company for engine, transmission, or other automotive needs. When they say customer service is their top priority - it is true! My MDX is back on the road, and shifting better than ever!!",US,2,2015-09-21T23:58:08Z,Street Smart® Transmission
