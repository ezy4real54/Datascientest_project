Alena & Brittany Johnson,0.6,"Disappointed in the renewal process

If I were rating only my experience with the customer service rep (Carlo) my rating for him would be a 4+. However, my experience with the totality of finding out that my contract had expired on July 10th was absolutely overwhelming and unsatisfactory. Apparently, a communication was sent via email in May 2022 meant to notify us that we were nearing the end of our contract. The primary heading of that email said that we did not have to do anything which we falsely assumed that
No action was required as stated at the top of the email was very misleading. Additionally, there are too many levels involved when there is a problem that needs to be rectified. I am appreciative that Carlo was knowledgeable of the process and helped resolve our issue. I still feel that we got dropped from the system once our rep left the company.",US,1,2022-08-16T19:07:11Z,ForeverCar

Simple Simon,1.0,"Very Pleasant Experience

I received an email offer nearly at the end of my car's original bumper-to-bumper platinum plan coverage through my bank's connections for a discount toward continuation of auto coverage with a third party. After I read the comparisons between Gold and Silver plans, I called the number a day later and got a live person immediately for the one question that I had about it to find out that it is a month-to-month pay as you go contract which works for me because I may decide to trade in or sell my car shortly after the 100k mark. Previously, I had to pay all at once for a 3-5 yr plan. This plan only charges me per month for coverage and I can stop it anytime without fees or hidden charges for up to 36 months! After a few days later I went online and filled out all the information and set up my contract hassle-free.

I am trying to figure out what I need to do to keep the plan and payment amount? I am hoping someone will take the time to help me out.

Shanna Meow,0.2,"I want to begin by saying maybe avoid…

I want to begin by saying maybe avoid buying from Carvana unless you need to. Selling to them is fine. If you do end up buying from them, ignore the ""warranty"" from forever car because, no matter how many times they say it covers something, all they tell you is what they DON'T cover, which is everything really. Maybe they only cover the engine dying? Who really knows bc first they offer you a deal saying it's an extension but after you sign up, you get the contract and it basically says what it don't cover only so good luck deciphering that. Then, there are extra steps you need to remember to cancel, you can trust call and cancel (even tho that's the only way to cancel), you have to call them, be in hold for a while, then tell them you need to cancel, they ask you questions then you have to wait for an email and you have to put everything you already told them on the phone to verify you really want to cancel. They told me they didn't cancel by phone only because people would cancel then be confused they canceled? Okay, but wht about all the people complaining you are taking their money?? I would think that would be worse because it is people's MONEY? So, anyway, their customer service is also terrible, the manager I had to talk to was Orlando and he just sounds like a broken record talking about the contract over and over, not helpful. I ended up just saying bye and hanging up after the 5th time he said the same thing. That was my experience, you can decide for yourself though. Definitely check out reviews on BBB, they are not as good as these reviews.",US,2,2022-04-26T00:27:06Z,ForeverCar

Louise,0.2,"Poor Customer Service !!!

As soon as I purchased my policy I looked to see that the address was incorrect, fictitious in fact as it included an old street address and an unknown city in a state I have never lived in. Concerned about how it happened I called and was told the only way it got I there was because I entered the data. Really? Customer service thinks I don’t know where I live? And he had the audacity to tell me repeatedly it was my fault.
The poor customer service as well as the corrupt data put me off on the company’s integrity. I didn’t want to find out that the service would be null and void if and when I need it because of a glitch in the system.
I canceled my policy during the same call. Let’s see if he can get that right.

Update: In spite of Orlando’s reply I still believe I am intelligent enough to know my own address and how to enter it correctly when prompted. I chatted with a couple people before doing a cursory review of the policy and then going back for the purchase. So, yes, I completed the enrollment by myself online. The online application asked for confirmation of my car year make & model, VIN, my zip code and what level of deductible I wanted. Only at the point of payment was I asked for an address and although that was auto filled I confirmed it to be correct. The response to me asking how the address was so corrupt on the policy did not merit the repeated accusations that “I” entered bad data. By the time I called I had updated the data online myself. But I had lingering concerns about how it would affect the future performance of the policy. So I called to quell my doubts. I did not expect or deserve what I got. It did not need to end as it did.
I’m still waiting for an email confirmation that the policy was cancelled as discussed with Orlando.",US,2,2022-01-18T22:30:10Z,ForeverCar

Dwayne Shelby,0.2,"What a Week!!!

I have had a terrible experience last week. I know you all are in a partnership with Carvana and Silver Rock. 1st my check engine light came on January 1st so it wasn’t anything that I could do at that time. I dropped my car off Monday to a in-network repair shop Autotrust Repairs LLC. When I dropped it off the check engine light was off but they I left it because they told me they will figure it out. The did a diagnostic test on it Tuesday afternoon the results should that “Excessive pistol ring blow by causing the engine to run rich” I was very confused as to what was just said to me. They told me that too much fun is running to the engine. They also to me that I would probably have to have my engine replaced. I really felt confused then, I only had my car for 1 month, I just made my 1st car payment. I was not happy at this point, the mechanic asked me if I was past the time to get my money back. This was definitely a red flag, now I’m very upset with Carvana for selling me a car with a major issue like this. So now Silver Rock is brought into this nightmare and they told Autotrust Repairs LLC that I need to bring my car to the dealership because it was still under the manufacturer warranty. But I had to pay $110 for the diagnostic test due to Silver Rock wanting me to bring my car to the dealership. So now Cowboy Kia brought into this nightmare. Wednesday Cowboy Kia called me and told me that my car was not covered by the manufacturer warranty due to me not being the original owner. Now I’m even more upset. It could have stayed at Autotrust Repairs LLC and I would not have to pay the $110 diagnostic fee because the cost would have carried over to the repairs that needed to be done. Cowboy Kia told me that they did not see the issue but they will do a recall repair on it. They also told me that my brakes needed to be replaced. Now I’m furious because this is something that Carvana should have caught before they put my car up for sale. Now Cowboy Kia is expecting me to pay a $240 fee for the brake work that need to be done. It’s a lot of people that dropped the ball on me and I am not happy. I file complaints through Silver Rock and Carvana and no one has reached out to me to help resolve this nightmare of a week. I gave you all a 1 ⭐️ I wish I could have given a 0 ⭐️. Because you all are in the same circle. Oh yeah I forgot I had to get a rental car for $150.",US,1,2022-01-09T16:27:16Z,ForeverCar

My manufacturer warranty is almost up on my vehicle so I decided to research other options outside of the extended warranty offered by my dealership.

I called and spoke to a representative (Victoria) who was very helpful and answered all of my questions regarding what was included and not included in the package. With Victoria’s help I was able to choose a package with significant coverage that also fit my budget. Victoria was very knowledgeable about the product and also very personable. After I compared the price of the Forever car contract with was being offered for 36 months or 36,000 miles by the dealership it was apparent that Forever car was the better deal.

All three of these staff members were professional, knowledgeable and respectful of my decision to rejoin the 4ever Car Program.

The only problem I have is when I down loaded the PDF sent to me, the document was blurred and I have no idea what the contract contains. I've made 3 attempts once at my local library and with 2 individuals who have a printer for their business, without success.

I have reached out to try and get a hard copy, however I've had to leave msgs, as I have not been able to speak to any live person in order to obtain said copy of the contract.

I would like a hard copy for my records and by obtaining said copy, this would completely assure me I am able to maintain the standard of our agreement.

Andrea,1.0,"Membership in Action

I received information from Clark County credit Union in Nevada regarding ForeverCar coverage for car repair maintenance. CCCU was offering a discounted rate as a member to have coverage for my vehicle. I made phone contact with Emily from ForeverCar to gain more information on coverages. Emily was very personable, knowledgeable and Informative. She reviewed all coverage information including rental car reimbursement, trip interruption and roadside service. Emily discussed three different options for deductible, monthly payment information and disclaimers for coverage to be in effect. Based on information given during our conversation, I decided to enroll for the Silver Plan Coverage.
Thank you Emily for all your assistance in this matter and for your outstanding customer service.
I will recommend this beneficial coverage to any of my family or friends that are Clark County Nevada credit union members.",US,2,2021-10-06T00:49:42Z,ForeverCar

Most 3rd party warranties are a scam at worst and terrible to work with at best. This one is different. I’ve never had any trouble processing claims and the shop does all the work of filing the claim. I literally just hand them the paper with the phone number to call when I drop off my car and that is it. No other steps. I even had to take my car to the dealership to get the backup camera fixed because the independent shop I use was not comfortable doing it. It was just a $50 fee for using an put of network shop but again, it was easy and hassle free. Worth every penny I pay each month and the small fee if it’s out of network. For me, it’s hard to put a value on having the peace of mind this provides.

My concern is that when I read the policy, it kept stating what it does not cover rather then what it does cover.

Bought a minivan from Carvana. Used the 100 day/4000 mile included warranty twice successfully. They offered an extended plan from ForeverCar. Decided to get it for a couple of months in case someone else needs attention. The rep, Alex, was helpful. I asked if there are any authorized in-network shops in my zip code. It took him a while to figure out how to find out. ForeverCar should give their reps a quick link they can refer to for new customers. I wouldn't have gotten this plan if I had to travel 100 miles just to get to an authorized shop. Hoping we don't experience any breakdowns with the vehicle but it's a bit comforting to know we may have it covered by the plan.",US,4,2021-06-18T22:46:05Z,ForeverCar

This is a terrible company with very deceiving business practices. My credit union referred me to the company, so I made the mistake of thinking they were background checked and s safe bet. Here is my issue, when I was called the sales person advised me the silver package for coverage was a good package to invest in, but the platinum package was the best one they offered. January 2021, I purchased two packages at once, one for my mother (platinum) and one for me (silver). Between the months of April & May, I filed two claim after mycheck engine light come on. I took the car to my mechanic and after troubleshooting the issues he determined the camshaft sensor was band the headlights ECU needed to be replaced. We called ForeverCar and the mechanic was told to reach out to a third-party company. The third-party informed my mechanic there was no coverage passed on the vehicle's mileage. I called to dispute this with Forevercar and the end result was them explaining the Silver policy wording has to specifically state it covers a specific component that failed or it's not covered by the policy i.e my camshaft sensor failed, but the policy only states it covers a failure to the entire camshaft system. Also, the headlights computer was not listed per Orlando in customer service. The policy has been canceled as of May 2021.

My recent experience filing a claim with ForeverCar was a good experience.

I had dropped off the car at my local mechanic and explained that they would need to contact ForeverCar before beginning any repairs. It did take a couple of days for the mechanic to provide photos and other information that was requested, but in the end ForeverCar covered just over $1200 of a $1700 repair bill.

Truly thought this would have been a good company to carry on with my extended warranty after the one I purchased when I bought the truck. Inspection at Christian Brothers took 1 hour and 45 minutes. The vehicle only had 61,000 miles on it. After reaching back out to them to ask for next step they state they just got the report and it failed die to squeaking brakes (brake dust on a vehicle that doesn't get driven much). The representative also states something wrong with ball joint, but wait, offering to help with getting so-called problems fixed. Have heard many friends complaining about Christian Brothers taking advantage of customers. Very unfortunate and sure does seem like a you scratch my back I will scratch yours.

Customer: Valuable customers,0.6,"Extended car warranty by Forevercar:

The extended car repair warranty sales representative, Miguel Pineda, was clear and articulate and knew his products very well. He answered my questions straight away. Mr. Pineda is a great asset for the “Forevercar”. Easily he gets a 5 Star survey rating. The 3Star rating is due to the excessive period of non-coverage (1000 miles) before my extended car warranty is activated. The product I chose was the Platinum policy. There are a few unassailable conditions that handicaps the integrity of this sale; 1.) the monthly cost expended and invested into this warranty with no safety net for spontaneous repairs before the 1000 (test) prequalification mileage is reached.
2.) During COVID-19 we are regulated and restricted in all directions which has lowered our annual driving (average miles) and our spontaneous travel daily. In short, conceivably it may prolong the time it takes to reach the targeted 1000 mile prequalification.
3.) This is seen as unreliable acess to a product that is paid for monthly. That is a pretty high investment for no coverage. All other insurance covers immediately where the payment is secured and a binder for policy coverage is acknowledged.
The rating of three is given to the company for this very questionable and unfavorable contractual condition.",US,4,2021-02-09T20:34:31Z,ForeverCar

If this was 30 days OR 1000 miles whichever came first, this would be ok. Now if you decide to change this policy to not charge me until I reach 1000 miles I thought the insurance was a good deal and would like the insurance and you would get 5 stars.",US,1,2021-01-12T20:58:13Z,ForeverCar

Carlo's personality, professionalism, and knowledge made the process of signing up with Forever Car go so much more smoothly, and definitely contributed to my decision to choose Forever Car for my extended warranty. I genuinely look forward to dealing with Carlo if/when I need servicing through Forever Car. Thank you.",US,1,2020-11-04T17:36:18Z,ForeverCar

Customer,0.6,"Semi-Satisfied

I'm not sure where my dissatisfaction lies. The dealer advised that I had to pay for the cost of diagnostics because the warranty was refusing to pay for it yet forever car stated that the diagnostic should be covered so I had to have the dealer reach back out. That was not a positive experience as I had to be the one to mediate that. Additionally, I was only provided a standard vehicle that seats 5 small people. I have a household of 6 people and basically was told that my I had to pay extra so that my kids could sit in the car safely. I don't think that is right. As a warranty policy holder, my vehicle should be covered for rentals of the same exact size or higher now a downgrade.

The plan coverage helped with the repairs of a window regulator which brings a power window up and down. The plan also replaced the camera in my car. My cost for the entire job was a deductible of $100. The plan saved me over $1,200. I have continued reassurance if anything else comes up that I can get it repaired for my $100 deductible.

M. McDaniel,1.0,"I love all of the options and some advice

I love all of the options available and the comparable system being color coded. Make sure you read through each plan and also the warranty coverage agreement. Before choosing. I always do. It helps to know what to expect in the future. I have been in the auto industry for almost 30 years, so knowing what will or might happen with my particular vehicle 2018 Suburban, and current market repair prices; made my decision easy on which plan to choose. Being that said, my advice is to call your repair facility and ask what the repair will cost On your particular vehicle before you choose a plan and one last piece of advice; choose a lower deductible; it will save you when or if you need to use the warranty in the long run- well worth the extra $5 a month. Do your research, the monthly cost is well worth it.",US,1,2020-06-10T17:15:05Z,ForeverCar

To begin, I am 85 & wear two hearing aids & often have trouble hearing on the phone. I was fortunate to get Miguel who took his time explaining everything to me & making suggestions that would best suit my situation. He told me our conversation wold be recorded & asked me If I was comfortable with that & I agreed. He was kind & patient with me & gave me time to locate & retrieve pertinent information. When answering some questions I often got off track but to me it was all pertinent to the questions. He would listen and subtly & professionally bring me back.

When finished he asked if I had any more questions & I said no, but was there anything that I should have asked. Miguel is wonderful with elderly people & appreciated his time, patience and consideration. I pray that he and his family are safe and well at this time of Covid 19.

Overnight I thought of a question concerning the 25% discount that Tru Mark Credit Union had said I would receive & wanted to check that I had. I called back today and got Bryan who said that I had received it & that it is built in. Bryan also was very polite while answering my question, although I did say you promise I have received the discount & he responded 1000%.

Had to use my warranty recently and the experience was one I just had to share. I gave my mechanic the information to call in for approval of my repair.

I chuckled when he called me shortly thereafter with nothing less than astonished praise for your company. He said the agent answered promptly and professionally, asked the necessary questions and completed the transaction within a few minutes.

Without him, I might have passed on this warranty - I was reluctant anyway after a disappointing previous experience with a very high-profile warranty company whose representative rudely offered an expensive policy with vague “discounts” and a “take it or leave it” offer.
David showed me the actual ForeverCar warranty contract and exactly what was and wasn’t available for our particular vehicle; the decision was ultimately fairly simple. I look forward to three years of additional driving security.",US,2,2020-03-26T17:41:54Z,ForeverCar

I purchased Forever Car in March of 2019 for my 2011 Dodge Ram 1500. I've always kept maintenance service current. But being 10 years old it finally had a major problem. My engine light came on and within 15 minutes I was at the dealership where I purchased it. The service tech informed me that most Warranty places are not open on Saturday. An hour later I was told it was my water pump and my cost would be $122.00 I was so thankful because the total cost was $681.47. Keep in mind the policy you purchase determines you deductible. Forever Car was there when I needed them, even during the Covid-19 crisis. I was back on the road in a few hours. Thank you

I have had in the past other extended warranties and theirs unlike yours was a failure and did not even come close to your protection . I was having second thoughts when i had to take my car to the shop because of other experiences that i have had and when the service writer came into the customer lounge and told me that the repair was going to be covered by my extended protection i had formed my own conclusion about the protection i had purchased.The shop service writer was impressed to the point to tell me what a great warranty that i had purchased and wanted to know how i heard of your company and i told him that i was contacted after i purchased the car . I was so unsure of the warranty that i even call the credit union to see if they were endorsing your company the credit union called the office from where i purchased the warranty from to see if in fact that they were not a scam and called me back to let me know that your company was in fact on the up and up.After my claim i call the office from where i purchased the contract from to tell them as to how happy that i was to have purchased the warranty from them and found out the young lady who sold me the protection was no longer working for them so i told the person who i was talking to how happy i was that i purchased the protection . I can not say enough about your company or the dealer as to how professional ever one was and how concerned they were and that you and my self were not just another claim. With that said i can not say enough about your warranty and you can rest assure that i will promote your warranty to other people and please do not change your customer service ways as it has been a pleasure at this point to have done business with you and the dealer as to where the car was fixed congrats .

I had previously contacted another company and their prices were a lot more expensive and every time I told the person I wasn't ready to make a decision he would lower the price, but even their lowest price did not compare to ForeverCar. Carlo did not pressure me like the other company did. He just gave me answers and let me make my own decision. His explanation of each plan was very thorough and he was very helpful.

Laura Hicks,0.8,"Positive ending but not smooth sailing to get there

I went to my repair shop with a complaint of rough idle and vibration, only when applying brake at a full stop.
While it was there, I asked to check brakes, belts and hoses since I travel to Tampa a lot , in fact this week. I knew maintenance items were not covered, just wanted a safe vehicle.
I informed my repair facility that I have extended warranty coverage, and asked if they accept this, if it turned out we needed it. They said yes, no problem.
Melissa, from my repair shop called me with the findings:
It needed 3 motor mounts, the rear shocks were leaking, and they recommended an injection cleaning to remove carbon build up.
She said she would be happy to call and see what would be covered, if anything, before proceeding. I gave her my full contract # and the 800# to call, and said they could call me if needed to verify. About a half hour later, she called me back with bad news. She said (MRC) refused to work with their repair facility and when she asked to speak to a supervisor, was told that person was too busy to accept her call. Melissa referred to something about being a fleet provider and they can’t assist them with this request? We both had no idea what they were talking about.
Well, you could imagine my surprise. So I called (MRC) directly and conferenced Melissa into the call to find out what was going on.
My repair facility just bought the garage from previous owner in January of this year, and is keeping the name of Mitch’s Firestone, which is their DBA. Their corporate name is Elite Automotive Center and that’s how they file. The first person Melissa spoke to didn’t even ask questions to determine if she could assist her or not, she just heard the name Firestone and proceeded to read her the riot act and tell her there was nothing they could do. She didn’t even log that call, as I found out when we were on this conference call with Danielle. Danielle asked several questions while reviewing with a supervisor, and they were finally able to determine we could proceed with a claim. Hallelujah! (MRC) found their corporate name and they were included as a covered repair facility. This conference call took almost 2 hours to determine eligibility, to finalizing discussions of what would be covered, and next steps for my repair facility. It was not exactly a user friendly process, albeit ending positively because the motor mounts parts and labor were covered.
As a loan facilitator, I strongly encourage our staff to offer these services to members, as I am a strong believer of their value. That’s why I have them myself. We all have bad days, and previously working at a call center, I can empathize with the stresses of non-stop calls. I am hoping though, that the first women who took the call is the exception to the rule and not the rule. That could have went much smoother if she had taken the time to ask questions before refusing to help.
Overall, this 1 covered repair costs more than my entire policy did, so the products works and it lives up to its claims.",US,3,2020-02-26T01:16:45Z,ForeverCar

Deveré Locke,0.2,"Predatory business practices

I purchased this warranty 18 months ago and never filed a claim until a few days ago. I recently had an issue with my car and attempted to file a claim since my transmission needs to be replaced. The adjuster refused to approve it and instead kept reiterating that I authorize (aka pay out of pocket) the repair shop to fully break down my transmission and look for another source of failure since I had a fluid leak and need to PROVE the transmission failed for another reason since fluid leaks aren’t covered. I've had other warranty providers and never had to prove the source of failure. Sidebar: I would've stayed with my previous warranty provider (which I had FOR SEVERAL YEARS) but they no longer offered coverage for my vehicle since its an older model.

I purchased a powertrain warranty that includes transmission coverage. When I called customer service I spoke to 3 different people who gave me the run around. The worst was Blake who asked me to show him where in my contract the specific part that was damaged in my transmission was listed. Carlotta the adjuster/assessor was no help and I was told she was the 'manager'. She was clearly fed up with me inquiring about my claim which was indicated in her tone of voice and continued sighing throughout our call. So at the end of the day this warranty is a waste of money. The transmission is covered but not the specific part that's broken in the transmission? Hmmm interesting...

This is truly pathetic/horrible customer service and you’re better off going with another warranty provider. I am cancelling my warranty and posting a review on every known site (Google, Yelp, IG, Facebook, BBB, etc). I’ve already wasted my time and money but hopefully I can save future customers from being preyed upon.",US,1,2020-02-20T22:09:00Z,ForeverCar

Seems ok. Not very clear what date to establish the account. Assumed that the date you start is the day of the contract.

While we can’t yet (and hopefully won’t ever have to) speak regarding the fairness and effectiveness of our Forevercar agreement as we just purchased it, we do feel we’ve been treated very well thus far. Brian Sirt was the person we dealt with and he could not have been more thorough and professional. He was very patient with us and our many questions, we never felt a sense of being pressured by him at all.

The location that Forevercar sent us for our initial inspection was a shop I was unfamiliar with but was equally impressed not only by the reviews on Yelp and other sites but by the way they handled the inspection process. While discussing with the shop manager used vehicle warranty companies he was upfront that he had not dealt with Forevercar directly but he was impressed that they required the level of inspection they had the shop perform prior to offering us a warranty/service contract. His words were to the effect “he though if a warranty company requires an initial inspection it makes it that much easier for all parties to feel comfortable with the warranty should a covered repair be needed down the road”

If down the road we need to utilize our agreement with Forevercar for a covered repair or repairs, we hope that the same level of care and professionalism will be extended to us at that time.",US,1,2019-10-17T17:38:02Z,ForeverCar

TERRIE BEACH was the representative I had the pleasure to speak with. She was very courteous and professional. She answered all my questions without hesitation and didn't try to pressure me in anyway whatsoever to decide to purchase the police at once. I can truly say it was one of the most pleasurable experiences I have had to communicate with someone online in quite a long time. I feel the policy was the absolute best that I purchased. I have been looking and comparing many, many warranty companies for my vehicle and Forever Car is hands down the absolute best of the best. for the price. They have an A+ rating from the BBB and have been in business for over 50 years. That right there should tell you something positive about the company. I highly recommend purchasing their policy. Now I have piece of mind in case I have any issues with my 2011 Ram knowing it will not cost me $1000,s of dollars to be repaired.

I received a request to review ForeverCar, about a week after I purchased the policy. Per the limitations, I can't even use the benefit until a minimum of 30 days after purchasing, which I agreed to. But how are you going to ask me to review you before I even use the benefit? I think asking for reviews is tasteless. Asking for reviews when I haven't even used the benefit?

Heather M,0.2,"Buyer BEWARE

Buyer BEWARE! Check first with your preferred mechanic or dealer to see if they will honor this coverage. My dealer refused to work with them due to the time involved in trying to get claims processed. Additionally, I didn't find this out until I had already had the coverage for 6 months and spent $450. That money was refused to be refunded to me on the grounds that they didn't break the contract in their eyes. When asked for a list of providers local to me they gave me one. The one they provided wasn't an acceptable option for me. Bottom line is that if you don't verify first that your mechanic will honor this warranty you can expect to go through a hassle at a minimum, and lose money in the process. I will add that I checked with both local Jeep dealers, as well as an independent mechanic that a friend of mine uses and not only did they say they wouldn't work with this insurance but they gave the reason that it's too much a hassle to get claims processed through this carrier.",US,1,2019-04-11T14:34:59Z,ForeverCar
James Garth,1.0,"Car repair done easy

I have had a problem with Car repair company’s not trusting in businesses like Forever car. But Forever Car has made a believer out of at least one of them. Gordon Chevrolet gave me a hard time about getting paid from the warranty and how they would hold my vehicle until payment is received. That was the attitude until they talked to the Claims department for Forever Car and his disposition change and he said he had the easiest and best experience with them. Made it a breeze to get everything done. Thanks for the professionalism and great work Forever Car.",US,1,2019-04-10T21:04:52Z,ForeverCar

I received the information and could navigate through the website very easily to see payment options and what's covered and equally important...what ISN'T! Great value and piece of mind knowing my truck is 95% covered! I recommend ForeverCar plans and Brian!

Since I cant reply to your message below. INTERSTATE LIES MY REPAIR FACILITY TRIED CONTACTING THEM FOR 3 DAYS AND IT IS RIDICULOUS. I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND HOW I AM STILL RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TEAR DOWN TO FIND THE PROBLEM YOU GUYS ONLY PAID FOR THE OIL PUMP. LIKE I SAID FOREVERCAR.COM AND INTERSTATE ARE SCAMMERS. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOREVER.CAR TO ANYBODY. PLEASE DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY. YOUR VEHICLE IS NOT COVERED.I am writing another review cause I am very unhappy with the way things have progressed. THIS WARRANTY PLACE IS A SCAM. My car broke 3/4/2019 and they did not approve anything until 3/12/2019.Finally when Interstate the place that approves claims approved my claim I was still going to be paying out of pocket over $1,100.00. When the mechanic finished my vehicle one of the gaskets blew and the warranty place will not cover that and now my total out of pocket is going to be over $3,300.00 which I don't have. Forevercar.com and Interstate are a bunch of scammers. When you purchase this extended warranty they make it sound like its wonderful and there is nothing to worry about if your car breaks down. LIES I have been stressing for the past 2 weeks about my car and how I am going to come up with the money for my vehicle. Please do not waist your money. Do your research. Even reading the contract it is very confusing. I have been fighting with this company to get the claim processed and it is been a struggle. The repair facility has been fighting with them to get my claim processed and it has been a struggle for them. I would give it negative stars if I could.

Well, this should be my 2nd review. Actually had to make a claim, although it is made through a partner coverage company, Interstate, it went well. My transmission went out on me out of nowhere. There were a few warning signs but didn’t figure out it was the trans until I couldn’t shift. Too late by then, except for this warranty. My budget is tight, but it’s already proven itself valuable because I would not have been able to get this repaired so soon without the warranty. It took about 2 weeks , but the wait was worth the savings and getting my car back on the road as I can't afford to replace a transmission. Great customer setvice as well, very nice people.

I can’t thank forever car enough for being there for me!! I paid my monthly for 11 months and was beginning to think “why am I doing this? I’m just wasting money,” but I kept it up and then... BOOM. My transmission went out. I immediately dreaded the process that I believed laid before me. My mind was BLOWN. They sent a wrecker within 2 hours to my house to get my vehicle and took it to my Nissan service department. Once the diagnosis was complete, they sent a Nissan certified rebuilt transmission to Nissan within 5 days (the Nissan folks were blown away as most extended warranty companies send dirty salvaged parts. This transmission was clean and ready for install). I paid my $100+$9 tax and I had a $1700 transmission installed. I couldn’t be happier with forever car. I just had to cancel because I bought a new(ish) car that is still under factory warranty, but when it’s not anymore, I’m 100% signing back up for forever car. Do not hesitate, do not wait, do not overthink this... sign up now and lay your anxiety to rest. ESPECIALLY if you drive rideshare. Do it!!",US,1,2018-12-01T01:35:55Z,ForeverCar

P. Shepard,1.0,"BMW and ForeverCar vs. Endurance

I ended up buying a policy through Assurant. It is a bit more expensive than the ones offered by Interstate, but I am hoping they will actually pay claims. I hate insurance, but my BMW is out of warranty and a few minimal issues could hit $3000+ pretty easily. I was also shopping Endurance, but I thought Assurant would be more likely to pay out even though they are more expensive than Endurance. Honestly, I am on the fence if I made the right choice between the two companies. I did a claim test this morning and Assurant had a call me back feature whereas Endurance had me on hold for about 30 minutes when I tried to replicate the claims process.",US,1,2018-10-25T14:59:46Z,ForeverCar

Bought Forever Car, now they are saying that I should have never been able to buy it in the first place. Now my car sits at the dealership needing a new clutch, and they say it doesn't cover manual transmission or manual transmission clutches. Also, it isn't a manual it is an automatic transmission. The clutch is an internal lubricated part, it should be covered, it is inside cast aluminum and it needs to have oil to work properly. Forever car is also saying this isn't their issue it is Interstate's issue. They are just passing the buck onto Interstate who I have already called and they said to call Forever Car to straighten this out. Again, my car is sitting at a BMW dealership and now they are saying my contract is void because nobody wants to pay out and are coming up with EXCUSES. Why am I being blamed for this? I spoke with Orlando Wilson from Forever car and he didn't seem to understand my vehicle was an auto and not a manual.

I had a problem with my vehicle transmission and I took it to the dealer where I purchase it.
They check it out and found the transmission was bad. They replace the transmission and I was back on the road within four days.
I will recommend forevrcar to my friends and family. They were very professional in handling my claim no question asked.
Just wanted to thank Orlando for his professionalism in seeing that my vehicle was repair in a professional and in a timely manner.
Also I want to thank enterprise for their special attention they gave to my vehicle as well.

Samantha is an excellent customer service/sales lady and was very thorough in describing the different levels and what was covered on each. She is very professional and also friendly, easy to talk to I had several questions to clear up different parts of the coverage and Samantha was consise and knowledgeable about the service.

Make sure to read through the contract. There are multiple stipulations that serve as easy outs for them to not cover any repairs. One of them that is particularly ambiguous is the ""Modified car"" one. I inquired as to what that means and they stated that basically any non-manufacturer modification disqualifies vehicle from coverage. Dealer installed aftermarket exhaust or wheels on your car? Good for you. You replaced a broken radio? Goodbye. Dared to install aftermarket headlights? Have a good day.

It appears to be a really good deal. I won't really know until I need a repair.

The process was much easier than dealing with other providers. The contract requires regular scheduled maintenance be done. Based on that, I assume they have information on required maintenance for all the contracts they sell, It would benefit them and their customers if they provided a site to track maintenance with reminders. This would help customers remain in compliance reducing their overall payout on repairs. This would also alert them immediately when a customer is out of compliance.

My sales person was friendly and helpful. She guided me to the right product for me, without pressure. That said, my comfort level with the process was not high. Given the bad name that the extended auto warranty industry has I wanted to proceed with extreme caution. Handing out your credit information to a company ypou've never heard of is disconcerting. My main issue was that I could not a quote in writing, by email. Such a quote would contain, at a minimum, the amount of the monthly premium, the term of the contract, the miles and years of the coverage and a detailed account of what was covered. The declarations page defining all this detail is not availble until afer you sign up. I don't fault the sales person for this, but I do fault the system.

I cannot comment at all on whether or not this company will deliver on its promises. It may be years before I file a claim. I will not know until then if I can recommend this company to others. If you are a prospective buyer, please proceed with caution.",US,1,2016-07-01T13:33:23Z,ForeverCar

Eric Fettingis who also assisted me with my extended warranty for my 2008 Cadillac with the high coast of everything they really made me feel at ease with purchasing their product , They made the process of finding the right warranty less stressful , I will refer this company to anyone who is looking for an extended for their vehicle ,It so far i would say that they are a keeper, Good Ratings with BBB, I just brought my warranty so i'll give it some to see how they will do along the way.
The Price is GREAT!!! and I also brought a warranty for my tire and wheels we get a lot of pot hole damage to our tire during our cold winter month this was also a great price.

I was quite skeptical about purchasing an extended warranty since I was not sure I'd be keeping my present vehicle. I'm still not certain of its future.
But the thought of having ANY warranty issue not covered during the current financial status was even scarier. Especially since I can't verify exactly when my warranty actually expires. So, for me, it was better safe than sorry.
If I do sell or trade-in my present vehicle, I can discontinue this policy which is the benefit I needed as well.

DO your homework when buying an extended warranty. Forever just sells the warranty. Research the companies they represent to make sure their ratings/reviews are up to par.

They will answer the sales calls and rarely answer or make you wait 30+ minutes on hold to talk to customer service.
