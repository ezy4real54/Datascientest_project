Shipping was extremely fast. Received my item in 3 days I think.

Straight forward installation and a great product to keep the turbocharger cooler. Adds bonus horsepower as well without having to make any major modifications to my 17' Civic Sport Hatchback. This intercooler, bought at a fairly priced discount compared to other suppliers, is a worthy replacement for the cheap OEM intercooler that comes installed from the factory.

Michael Reyes,1.0,"Purchased INVIDIA Cat Back Exhaust…

Purchased INVIDIA Cat Back Exhaust system for 2016 Civic. They had stock, at a good price, order was processed and shipped quickly. Non expensive shipping a plus. Had issues with carrier(FedEx) as they failed their scheduled delivery date by their own fault and noted it as ""recipient not available"" when I had taken the day from work to wait for the package...later on that day they went back on their statement and labeled it as a mistake on their logistic (switched delivery vans during the day when it was already available to be delivered). Made me wait all day until 8pm telling me they would still deliver but didn't, they ended up delivering on next business day with me having to take another day of work because package required signature...like I said, the carriers fault and not Pro Civic. Easy fitment and installation. Overall great experience with Pro Civic aside from the carrier errors. Would purchase from them again.",US,1,2022-03-29T15:54:22Z,procivic.com
Talen,0.8,"Pro Civic has yet to miss

Pro civic has yet to fail me for genuine aftermarket parts for my 2018 Civic. Each order has been processed and shipped quickly, and delivered within 2 weeks of placing my order.
Of course, aftermarket parts are not always a perfect fit for OE factory replacements, but they fit snug enough and look great!
ProCivic has quickly become one of my go-to sites for discovering new ways to breathe life into my vehicle and truly customize the way I desire.

Brian B,0.8,"Overall a pretty good experience with a few exceptions

Overall a pretty good experience. However, I bought the OEM fog lights for my 2016 civic and the wire harness where the h11 bulbs go into was not working on one side. I had to buy a new harness from autozone and once that was hooked up everything worked. I also wish there was a wiring diagram so I know what color wire is what. Although I got everything to work, a guide & a wiring diagram would have been great for a DIY’er. One thing I believe that separates the product I got from the a million add a fog light kits on eBay is the fitment. The fitment is absolutely perfect there are no gaps & nothing is loose. I couldn’t have picked a better kit. Overall besides the wiring harness problem, I would buy again.",US,1,2022-03-25T23:34:18Z,procivic.com

I’ve had some interesting experiences with online retailers before, and they never have good customer service either.

I can tell you that ProCivic cares about their customers and they stand behind their products all the way and some more on the top.
I’ve had two separate occasions that I have needed to reach out to their customer care and I’ve been blown away.

Each time, they respond faster than anything I’ve seen and always provide great solutions to the problem. Both of my requests ended up needing replacement items (neither of which were at the fault of ProCivic and I don’t blame their products either) and they practically overnight the replacements to you at no cost. And come to think of it, I haven’t been questioned or “interrogated” like you sometimes will be when requesting a replacement item from a lot of places. It’s a show of trusting their customers.

Every item I’ve purchased has been great quality and I’m happy with them. So between that and my customer care experiences, I’m a customer for life.
At the very least, it’s great knowing that I’ll have a response to a question typically within a few hours.

IsmaelJames Panda,0.2,"Never Again

I do not know the ropes yet because it was my first time buying this kind of product online. I guess the shipping was fast but I was just a little skeptical because it took around 2 - 3 days till I received my tracking number. But surprisingly it took another 2 - 3 days and I received my order. I noticed while examining the order (Projector Matte Black Headlights) that it has a bare minimum RTV. We can fix that easy but my major problem was where you poke the Philips screwdriver to aim and align the low beam was placed at the bottom of the housing. Took me a while to figure out that I need a different low beam plug/socket but once plug all. The kog/wheel where I need to align the headlights hunts me again because having backwards was not a major thing but the location is very hard to reach like for example at the driver's side I need to remove the battery to reach it. Really?!?!?! It is located near the front blinker. Not so pro procivic. I am very disappointed and disheartened to myself for trusting you guy and picking your site for this project. I thought it was sealed enough but I was wrong because now it is fogging up especially compared to my old headlights (not original headlight) is a lot better than this junk. One problem after the another and that is all from this headlights (Projector Matte Black Headlights).",US,1,2021-10-10T09:22:07Z,procivic.com

These dudes are too much...homies now...i post one review and didnt ask for anything and these guys are sending me stickers. Much love my guys and thank you.

I purchased I set of headlights: PRO Design Black Headlights
Application: Honda Civic - 2006 to 2011 - 4 Door Sedan [All] (Projector With Halo, LED Lights) (Matte Black) this were the exact headlights. I purchased them in May 15th of 2021 and didn't receive them till the middle of June.. However that isn't my biggest complaint.. I waited to install them till I received all the parts to complete the work I was paying a professional to do on my 2011 Honda civic.. So after all the parts arrived I had the work begin on July 2nd and it finished on July 6th.. Anyway on September 2nd I noticed the halo light on my partner side headlight was already not working.. So I expected pro civic to do something about this yet I was sorely mistaken.. They told me in out of luck on there crappy product and they got my money and that's all they want.. I was very disapproved cause I had bought similar headlights to these on my old Honda build from China and had a similar experience so I wanted to avoid that by paying almost $100 more to get the same headlights from procivic.com. However I am now sitting here with the same exact experience except the Chinese company was willing to help me since the lights went or so soon and replaced them with a new set.. But Procivic isn't willing to help cause they only wanted my money.. So trust me when I say to be very wary about purchasing products from Procivic as they are clearly selling the same cheap products from China at a higher cost making you believe them to be a better quality product cause it's attached to there name. But you are just getting the same cheap deal at a marked up price and when it goes out just days after the 90 days you will be stuck with it and I assure you it will.. They don't last a year ever!..

Sam T.,0.8,"Nearly perfect, will visit again.

The peeps over at ProCivic are very professional, especially when it comes up to minor slip ups. I ordered an exhaust, that when the team checked, Ingen had falsely reported how many were left, and so ProCivic accidentally sold me nothing. The next morning I was, not just emailed, but called by a ProCivic employee, telling me everything that was up, and all of my options, i.e. if I wanted to wait until they were back in stock, if I wanted a refund, or if I wanted a different exhaust, and with me choosing the refund, he didn’t pressure me any other way and immediately refunded the order. I still, of course, wanted an exhaust for my squirrel powered car, and so I emailed the costumer support asking, “what exhausts are available for my car right now?”, in which Oscar quickly got back to me, stating which exhaust was in stock, how many were in stock, the price, the website link, and continued to tell me that if I ordered, they would make sure to ship it same day for me. I went on and ordered, and low and behold, an hour later I got a notice that it was already shipped off and headed home. The only improvement I would suggest is to stay more on top of inventory, but having worked in the industry, I understand how difficult it can be when there’s thousands of items listed.",US,1,2021-05-29T10:58:27Z,procivic.com

Product resembled online showcase, fit to size, installation was pretty simple as well. Fun mod to add!

On my stock 2019 Honda Civic Hatchback Sport, I can say that this intake WILL give you some very nice noises! Blow-off valve ‘whooshes’ are increased, and when accelerating, hearing the engine take in all that cold air sounds amazing, making me smile from ear to ear every-time I accelerate :) Highly recommended for people that wanna increase their civics performance and have some beautiful sounds to go along with it!",US,1,2021-03-16T04:22:40Z,procivic.com
Robert Jackson,0.6,"Disappointed with packaging

Upon intial inspection of my order (Truhart Street Plus Coilovers) i opened the package and noticed that the boxes inside of the main box were all ripped up, like it was previously opened before i received it. Looking at the actual coilovers i notice some of the coating on one of the rear springs was chipped off in a spot. I havent looked at any others yet in depth, that will come when installation takes place. I havent installed them yet but it looks to be that everything is there. Follow up review will come after installation in the next few days",US,2,2021-03-14T15:46:40Z,procivic.com

Bought window visors for my 2021 Sport Hatch, haven’t installed yet but have no directions, Have watched YouTube videos but all are for versions with clips. Tried mocking them up today to figure the install and they don’t seem to match up vs the last set I had for my Mazda 6. These may be returned, unless the install becomes easy and perfect. Seem to be a little small on each window, where 3m tape won’t hold to the window frame. Will revise this once I install.",US,1,2021-03-14T04:50:15Z,procivic.com

Nick,1.0,"Exceeded my expectations

Okay, so how and where do I start?? Well, lets start off when I placed an order on some cheap visors off of Ebay, not thinking anything of it I wait and finally they arrive in the mail. Opened them up and at first glance they looked okay... for Ebay visors. Fast forward the day I am going to install them on my Civic; after I tint all windows 5%. The visors it self looked horrible, I could literally see the blacked out tints through them. Long story short, never ever buy Ebay products that say ""JDM Authentic"" without actually reading the description. Now I was on the lookout for some good quality visors, and that is when I found out this ProCivic site! At first I was iffy about ordering them but once I did, not even a day later I get a notification that they have been shipped and will be on the way in 5 days. Today I received them and wow just wow am I shocked at how good they look! Though I have not yet installed them yet, they look so good in comparison to the Ebay visor. Had a great weight, very durable, the finish is very dark, similar to my 5% window tint too! I will definitely shop with them again soon. In fact, I will be ordering my suspension from ProCivic very very soon! Thanks ProCivic for the fast and easy experience.",US,1,2021-01-13T01:13:59Z,procivic.com

I ordered an exhaust by the name of ""pro design"" but I got a Spec-D exhaust instead. If I knew I was going to be getting a Spec D exhaust I would've bought it somewhere else for a lot cheaper. Also, the Procivic website says the exhaust piping is 2.5 inches in diameter, but the exhaust only measured out to be 2.36 inches OD and 2.25 inches ID. I honestly wouldn't consider this a true 2.5 inch exhaust, which I hoped I would be getting. This exhaust won't be much of an upgrade over my 2.25 inch I currently have. All in all, I was expecting a lot more than what I received, even though it was a cheap catback.",US,1,2021-01-11T06:03:59Z,procivic.com

Mark Lorenzo,0.6,"Missing Parts, ZERO Customer Service

I'm not very happy with this company. I ordered over $1400 in parts and wanted to surprise my son for Christmas by having them installed. The Seibon spoiler came with no hardware whatsoever. There is no info on the Seibon site, only a link to a ""spoiler installation page"" that is really just a car show article from 2014. I've called Procivic at least 5x, but you have to have a code/extension to talk to someone, supposedly it's sent over email after they've acknowledged an issue with your order. I spent 25 minutes trying to navigate the call tree like it was some sort of labrinth, even resorted to button mashing trying to crack the magic code needed to speak to a human. I've emailed twice and have yet to hear a response. I've decided that I'll likely have to send it back and dispute the charge on my credit card. I will probably also file a complaint with the Sec of state consumer affairs dept, it's not fair to have your money taken and receive zero support for incomplete products. We've ordered from Procivic before, but unfortunately this will be the last time for us. I expect more for the money that I paid for this...

Edit:. Found the email, it literally says that hardware ""should be included"" and reach out if I have any more questions. The hardware is not here. I would like to talk to someone that can get me the hardware needed to mount this spoiler.

Edit: updating to 3 stars. After I located the emails, the customer support did tell me the size so I was able to buy 4 from Ace Hardware. I strongly feel that you need to fix the phone situation, it's quite frustrating. In your reply, you say that they are set up for orders that are processing. I still have a part that I'm waiting on since mid dec (a month ago) and there's no way to get the status. I was not provided a PIN to reach someone over the phone.",US,2,2021-01-14T22:25:23Z,procivic.com

Pros: looks amazing 10x better then stock wing.

Cons: wings comes to you roughly made with seems all around the base and across the wing so if you wish to paint this your car color you will need to body fill the seems so it is smooth and looks nice I got mine painted and filled by a body shop was not cheap.

Wing wobbles slightly up and down in the center on the highway past 60 mph

You lose your third brake light not that big of a deal. If you are handy you can buy a third brake light for interior and put in the window if it bothers you.

Travis,1.0,"Not 100% perfect but still fantastic!

Got my wing in a week which is exactly when they said I'd get it. It arrived undamaged and went together perfectly. The fitment to the car isn't 100% but it's an after market part so I wasn't expecting perfection. There is also some additional work that needs to be done with sanding and body filler before it gets painted but again, it's not a factory part so I didn't expect it to be 100% perfect. But overall I think this is a great add-on to any civic and when it's painted it's going to look fantastic!
EDIT: I've had the wing painted for roughly 2 weeks at the time of posting this and it is amazing. Looks good, doesn't whistle, does bounce a little in the wind but it's solid when mounted correctly, it went together well and overall I think this was a good purchase. Do keep in mind the prep work was a bit heavy due to molding lines needing to be sanded out but other than that the final result to me looks amazing. Worth every penny I put into it.",CA,1,2020-10-10T00:35:38Z,procivic.com

George Cruz,1.0,"Track Day Saviors

I haven't ordered more than a handful of items from PRO CIVIC, but can confidently say that my shopping experience, and their customer service has been consistently above average. In a previous review, I mentioned that I very much respect that PRO CIVIC seems to keep their stock status updated, across the board. I have been planning to go tracking for several months, so I ordered a set of track day brakes (from a different online retailer) which I found out 2 weeks ago to be not only out of stock, but on backorder, about a month after I put in the order, and only because I sent an email to customer service. After finding this out, I quickly put in an order with PRO CIVIC for a spare set of brake pads in hopes that they would arrive before I leave for the track. There was a discrepancy in the availability of the pads, and I was IMMEDIATELY informed of the issue by a customer service representative THE SAME DAY I placed the order. To add to this, the representative was very honest about the situation, and explained that the items could be delivered within normal shipping time, but not expedited. When I asked how long that would be, I was told that it wouldn't be more than a few days more. At this point, there were about 7 days until I left for the track, and if all went according to what I had been told the items would have arrived today (2 days before I leave). The brake pads arrived yesterday, and the entire time I was waiting, PRO CIVIC made it their responsibility to CHECK IN WITH ME almost DAILY. I even have time to replace the pads before I leave for the track!

So in short, this last experience with PRO CIVIC has impressed me beyond expectation, and I hope that their business, and dedication to excellence within the harsh realm of customer service continues to set standards.",US,2,2020-08-20T00:47:00Z,procivic.com

I absolutely love their products and a big thanks to those who helped me with my purchases as well as with my questions. Big thanks to Anthony over at Procivic for major help!

Not gonna lie everytime I order something I run into problems that takes time to fix when I need parts ASAP I do like the items you guys sell but as of now I’m no longer gonna be ordering anything from here as I found another store with basically the same items except I get everything a lot faster and never have to worry about fixing something on an order and they give advice with the things you order which helps out so much for the install and tuning process

Edit: I definitely do appreciate the fast replies which is why I didn’t one star but this other spot let’s me know the stock before I order and go over the top to help me and so far haven’t had any problems but when things slowly get back to normal I think I will be using procivic again and based off how it goes I’ll change the my feedback",US,1,2020-07-18T16:59:00Z,procivic.com

During these times with Covid-19 its hard to find fast shipping and handling. Heck some times its even hard to get an order to be taken. ProCivic really comes through with fast shipping and handling! In less than 7 days total, (not business days) they had my parts to me. That might not seem ""special"" but even when other ""major"" companies offering 2 day shipping don't get it to you for 2 weeks that is saying something for ProCivic.

Price also seemed very fair for quality parts. I would recommend them to any Civic owner looking to buy aftermarket parts. 5 stars all around!",US,1,2020-07-15T22:06:49Z,procivic.com

Secondly, I tried ordering a DC Sports CAI from them only to be contacted again and find out dc sports had discontinued that intake.

One thing for 100% certain, you need a set of non-marring tools for plastic parts to reduced damage to the paint. Quality of the part was pretty good and it looks great on my car....

Placed a pretty big order had some things go onto backorder which they took the time to personally call me to inform me of the delay and if I wished to cancel. Most places just flat out cancel your order and refund you resetting you in the waiting Pool for whatever the parts are. Any questions I had for updates or recommendations for parts they answered quick sometimes even after hours they were still monitoring emails and answering. Had a issue with receiving my flash pro and Dave took extra time to answer me on updates and got it straightened out and the FP shipped next day for a quick turn around of the situation. All in all procivic Is definitely my go to parts site for my 9th gen or any other vehicles I may get that they carry product for.

Also, I know that when I ordered, it was out of stock and stock was coming in a few weeks but the shipping label was created and I was sent a tracking number, which got my hopes up.

Jeremy,1.0,"Sirimoto Subframe Suspension Kit

I pre-ordered two different kits since they were on sales during Memorial Day weekend. As soon as I submitted my orders, I was prompted with an email notification that one of the kits wouldn't be available till June '20. I was given an option to cancel it. I decided not to. I was immediately given a tracking # for my available kit. The package gotten to UPS very quickly and I was pleased with it.

As soon as UPS informed me there will be a delivery delay later than the original expected date. I decided to get in touch with UPS and let them know that I can pick it up. UPS sent me a text notification that my package was available and ready to pick up. When I get there, they couldn't find my package for half hour. They apologized and explained it is likely they've accidentally put the package back on the belt. It was very frustrating for me as a UPS customer.

I immediately got in touch with Pro Civic, I kept them in the loop and explained what was going on with my package and what I needed to do to get the proper customer service action in order to remedy my misfortune situation. Dave and Oscar immediately get back to me during business hours and expressed their awareness and were prepared to take care of me in case my package ever gets lost.

In the end, UPS found my package and I came to pick up. I informed and updated Pro Civic regarding to the package. The delay and misplacement of the package were out of Pro Civic's hands. They were aware of my frustration with UPS and worked with me and gave me their assurance.

I am looking forward ordering more products and doing business with Pro Civic in the near future. I feel like an important obsessed customer when it comes to Pro Civic and their customer services.",US,1,2020-06-01T17:10:32Z,procivic.com

So I just bought lowering springs and the rear visor for my Civic Si 2018, I will be opening and installing those this upcoming weekend.

The only reason I'm giving you 3 stars is because the shipping was really fast.

“Update!”

An agent from ProCivic contacted me and immediately helped me with my issue. They sent me the front lip again. Yesterday I installed it and let me tell you, the car is looking amazing. I am really happy to see how ProCivic managed this situation. I will keep buying all my Si part from this guys.

Justice Vang,0.4,"Poor TRM Spoilers

I’ve ordered the TRM spoiler 2 times for my 2017 Honda Civic Hatchback Sport, with Procivic, and both times the threaded sockets were poorly designed to where they just pop right out(not strong enough to even hold the screws). The first spoiler I bought fell off on the freeway because of the socket falling off of 3 of the holes they were supposed to be attached to to stay on, I know this because the threaded socket was still left on the screws that were sitting on my car. The second on I ordered, while installing it, I ran into two different threaded sockets that were very poorly managed as well and fell out during installation. My friends and I used industrial glue to stick the socket back in and it worked perfectly. But literally the next day after install, the other side that didn't pull off during installation popped up a little near the front right aide of the spoiler’s attachment to the car. Next thing you know it I look and you can see the threaded socket pulled out and off of the spoiler and sitting on the screw. The spoiler is still sitting on my car, but I’m afraid that it’s going to fall off again.",US,1,2020-05-08T21:14:35Z,procivic.com

I ordered a set of lug nuts for my 10th gen si. Because of covid I expected any company to take longer than usual with orders. My first experience was calling to make sure the item was in stock, at which time I was promptly connected with a very kind and helpful employee. After the call, I immediately placed my order. It arrived way faster than I had ever thought it would during this time. To put it in perspective how fast it was, I ordered a simple sticker from another business on the same day I made this order. This other business is no more than a 45 min drive from my home, it’s been well over a week and this other business hasn’t even shipped my sticker yet.

I’m quite upset with the new grill because I was hoping for a place to put my Honda badge but it was just a gapping hole. On the website it shows that the item comes with a silver Honda emblem so that I could mount in the grill but I also didn’t even get that. I also looked on amazon a couple days later and to my surprise that same grill was on there. So I spent 200 plus for a grill I didn’t even get. Where I could just went on amazon and got the same grill for 100. I am very upset.

After everything was sent through email and proof was shown about there product they replied to me quickly. They also sent me out the part to fix the problem as soon as possible. The part was a quick snap on to the grill they sent. My 2017 Honda Civic Si looks great with the new grill and badge. I am very satisfied with my purchase. They are a good company and very friendly.

A quick phone call and I was chatting with yet another very friendly individual who verified that I got what I needed. In the end, the exhaust is now on my car and looking/sounding great!

Great job guys! I'll definitely be using you in the future.",CA,1,2020-03-30T16:17:01Z,procivic.com

These people are amazing. Ships with in reasonable time. From returns to questions about what I’ve ordered, they have been amazing from start to finish. Also, they actually communicate and treat you like family. They aren’t just there for the sale. They also have a lot of product knowledge.

Tiffany K.,1.0,"Happy Honda Upgrade

My 17 year old son purchased an exhaust system for his Honda Civic. I was a little nervous about him buying something so expensive to be shipped across the country to Frisco, TX. I was pleasantly surprised to receive a customer service call the next day confirming the order, and to make sure someone would be home to receive it. We got the order on the date as promised and had it installed the next day at our local muffler shop. Great experience with this company! Would definitely order from them again in the future.",US,1,2020-01-01T17:13:49Z,procivic.com

Order a magnaflow exhaust got it a week ago started today to put it on. Had to go and get the bolts removed by a mechanic they were rusted and definitely need some high heat to remove so got that done. Had to get some new bolts couldnt reuse the factory ones. Got home and started removing the exhaust got it off went to put on the magnaflow and its for a 2 door civic and i have a 4 door 2013 civic si, so had to put my factory back on the donut gasket was trash had to get the wife to get one. Now i got to contact procivic and start all over again waiting to get the new and wait till my next day off to try this again. Will update if or when i get the other or whatever happens....Thursday contacted pro civic w the issue and they wanted part# and pics of it so i did so and Monday at noon haven't heard anything. Email 4 or 5 times and still nothing. All i want is the right exhaust. Ill update more on the whole process later this week mybe.....Monday 2:00 got an email back saying (Thank you for providing the images of the exhaust you have received. The warehouse has relayed the information over to MaganFlow to see what may be going on here.
As soon as we hear back from the manufacturer we will update you on what to do next. If you have any questions in the meantime please let me know.) Will update more on everything that goes on.So the whole deal is i need to contact magnaflow to get the issue resolved and if i would return it i would have to cover the shipping and take a 15% restocking fee so thats that. Crazy how this all ended up. So magnaflow is on the issue after about 4 or 5 emails. Pro civic said that there return department is working w me but i got 2 emails from them and that was about returning it at my charge or store credit. My whole point is when buying something is i want that company to take care of it, not heres the information u will have to get it taken care of.
So i contacted Magnaflow because pro civic didnt want to deal w it, sent a pic which i will put below measuring the mid pipe on the floor if i can. They sent me a schematic magnaflow for the measurements of exhaust sent pic and they said it was the wrong one. Got a new exhaust on the way. Order this 9/28/19 and paid 2 day shipping so definitely a big headache. It was a pain doing all this by myself. So by the 11/5/19 should have my new one.",US,5,2019-11-01T21:09:35Z,procivic.com

Ordered and the payment went through. Was called saying there was a problem with payment and to call to answer some questions. When I called the guy said he couldn’t talk to me because I didn’t have my card in my hand at the moment and I would have to call back to confirm something on the back of my card. I told him I knew my digits on the back of card but refused and told me I would have to call back when I had the card in hand. I told him to just cancel my order then because I didn’t have the time to call back and I don’t understand how there was a problem with payment when it already showed the transaction out of my bank account. Got a call back from someone else saying they could push the order through and if I still wanted my order they would send it.... don’t understand how before they couldn’t take my order and refused to let me answer their question because I didn’t have my card in hand at that moment, then to saying they would push it through somehow and didn’t need any more info. Super annoying while dealing with at work, especially when they could have just pushed the order through in the first place and still don’t understand how there was a problem when the transaction cleared in my account already.",US,1,2019-09-17T14:35:11Z,procivic.com

The spoiler I ordered is exactly as described, is made of good material and looks great on my car. However, the two support pieces received I installed 2"" from center of the window. I learned after the fact that they should have been installed at least 10 inches from center. This could have been clearly marked on the instructions sheet. I hope someone fixes that. I checked and I was unable to get another pair to install between the 2 and 10"" gap. So I hope it holds up well in winter weather.",US,6,2019-09-13T01:09:31Z,procivic.com

The guy with the broken Civic,0.2,"False description caused huge & expensive damage. I’m NOT happy.

I’ve only ordered one set of lowering springs from procivic. They were specifically designed for my particular car and were shipped quickly. I have no issues as far as that goes.
My problem is with the advertised springs I bought. The description on procivic describes the lowering springs as being able to be used with all stock components on a Honda Civic. I put the springs onto my new car, and within driving two miles at 25mph down my smooth street in town, my passenger side CV axel broke and both of my rear shocks blew out, requiring all to be replaced to the tune of over $1,000.00 (yes, one thousand dollars) at my local Honda dealer. None of this was covered by my car’s warranty since it had been lowered. Needles to say, I am extremely disappointed and furious.",US,1,2019-06-12T08:44:34Z,procivic.com

That being said at noon on a Friday I called procivic. It took approximately 3 minutes for them to identify the correct part they gave me three other options and said they could have it to me ASAP. I choose one of the options and it arrived before noon the next day. I can't possibly explain how impressed I am with Pro Civic.

Aaron Placek,1.0,"Buying the parts to build your dream car

Procivic has been great! I recently bought myself a civic coupe and I was looking for parts & styling accessories online but most sites don't have much & if they do have parts they don't explain the exact details & uses of them very well. Procivic has videos on installation and they explained exactly what to expect from the parts you are buying so that you can clearly decide if it is what you are looking for plus with the videos you decide if you can install it yourself . I have bought a few times already and my orders come fast and undamaged, nothing messing or anything. They have a wide variety of items which is great one place to find everything & prices are right everything I have ordered has been excellent quality. Procivic is my top choice when looking for my next upgrades and mods. I'm working on my suspension and you can bet I'll be buying my parts right here",US,1,2019-04-07T08:27:54Z,procivic.com

Made a mistake with the State information on my shipping address and got a call within a couple hours of placing the order to verify if the address/State i had entered was correct.

Lastly, I had requested for expedited shipping, but the person i was speaking to told me that the warehouse is close enough to my apartment that normal shipping will be fast enough and the extra cost for shipping was unnecessary.

UPDATE: Went straight from a 2-star to a 5-star when figuring out how to do it myself, because I love the product and the support team only does the best that they can, though their instructions leave a lot to be desired and makes them appear inept.

I'm willing to help anybody who has issues turning their lights from white to amber by being much clearer than they ever were in their instructions.



PREVIOUS REVIEW

------------------------------------------

Ordered clear side markers with LED strips for my Honda Civic Si.

First time I got smoked side markers and had to return them.

Second time I got the parts that I ordered, but their instructions for installing are so unclear that:

- They don't have photos which associate with the way I need them installed.
- They don't have photos involved with the vehicle itself.
- They have pieces that don't properly fit on the vehicle without trimming modifications.
- Their instructions indicate wires of different colors than that of the actual vehicle.
- Even when installed correctly, they don't function as intended.

The only reason they are getting more than one star so far is because they have been prompt with their shipping and replies, however I've already had to return an item after paying for shipping to have it arrive to me (money I had to eat), and if I have to do it again because they didn't deliver what was promised in that it doesn't function as intended, even if they do take it back for a full refund I will have to eat the shipping fees again.

I am very frustrated right now and would love for dozens of their representatives to not only troubleshoot this with me, but make significantly clearer and more correct instructions on installing these parts so that others don't have to incur exactly what it is that I'm feeling right now as well. If I can get this adjusted I will happily change my rating and review.",US,2,2018-12-08T21:21:23Z,procivic.com

I have ordered from procivic.com twice and will be doing so again, both times my orders where shipped promptly, packaged well, and arrived as described, had an issue with one part not shipping due to backorder, they called me, we found a replacement item and was taken care of in minutes. Huge fan, they have videos of installs to give you a head start on what you'll be doing, and seem too genuinely love civics as much as you do. One comment, they push sirimoto, which I totally understand, they collab, and the parts are high quality, but more instructions for specific years would be helpful sometimes, I did the phase 2 strut bar, followed the video, but it wouldn't go back together, turned out I needed to trim two clips on the cowl, not a big deal, just would have saved me 20 minutes to know that.

Matt Forsberg,0.6,"Disgruntled customer

Hello,



I have honestly had not the greatest experience with ProCivic. One of the first items I bought (Magnaflow Exhaust) came with a missing piece. I was given a chance to take a picture to prove it to one of your customer care workers but I was working 14 hour days and just couldn't do anything after work...things have calmed down now. The new issue is that I ordered my Diverter Valve with expedited shipping, it came after the ""2 to 3 days"" timeframe, was told I would get a refund, and still have not. To put the cherry on top once I received the Diverter Valve it was not the correct one. All of my parts come from ProCivic but I feel as if I have been somewhat swindled out of certain things including money and I sincerely am thinking of getting my future parts from other JDM websites. Customer support has been quick to reply, though, so there is that positive.



Thank you,

Honestly, I had an amazing experience with procivic.com, I gave them a call on Friday June 15, 2018. Had a couple questions about a Mishimoto Performance Thermostat for 8TH Gen Civic SI’s, Because My Fa5/Civic Si Build Has been Having some irritating random overheating issues that would come & Go, ProCivic.Com honestly fulfilled all of My concerns & answered every single 1 of My Questions, Part was IN stock & ready to Go, Rep Took my Order right over the phone w/Absolutely NO Issue, also Saved me a couple dollars by not having Me pay for express shipping, being that it was already Friday evening, the order is still going to take until Tuesday morning to arrive @ My Home, Which was The Same exact estimated shipping time under express (which I definitely appreciated their honesty).. All in all, I’ve received the part first thing Tuesday morning June 19TH, 2018 & Got Right to work on the Installation & have not had another overheat problem since, thanks to pro civic being able to get Me exactly what I needed for My Daily Driver/Weekend Track & Street Car with Absolutely no issues & all of their honesty & courtesy of making sure their customers are well taken care of, Will truly continue shopping w/Them in the near future!

Rice303,1.0,"Excellent overall but...

Website is very easy to navigate; I was able to find the exact parts I needed right away; descriptive descriptions also helped with the buying process. One thing I would add though (and sorry if I missed it on your website -I've probably missed it) is to add an estimate shipping time and whether or not a certain part is in stock or not. Kinda like how the website Carid does. Aside from that, the buying experience navigating through your guy's website is easy and flawless. One thing I particularly disliked was the extra verification process, I understand where you guy's are coming from - but I had a hard time calling and finding the right number. For some reason, two different numbers you've provided/linked was not able to patch me through, but I was able to find a third different number and was finally able to verify my order. I think that there should also be a different way of verifying an order since I was on hold for about 30 minutes. Stellar customer service though! Aside from that, ProCivic is one my favorite to-go for my Civic needs!",GB,1,2018-01-10T18:24:17Z,procivic.com

Tim Doty,1.0,"Pro Civic is great (Absolutely love their install vids on YouTube!)

Pro Civic is great. I've used about 5 vendors now since getting my Civic Si a month ago and they are up there with best. Sometimes it can be overwhelming picking a go to vendor, but these guys have great parts at really good prices.

Haven't had to deal with customer service so I can't speak to that. However, not having to use customer service is a great sign everything went well IMO.

What I really like about Pro Civic, are the install videos they have on YouTube. Even with straight forward installs, the little pointers they have make your job easier. I even used their Strut Tower Bar install vid to install the Tanabe bar I got from another vendor....Will stick with Pro Civic from now on because the other vendor was slow, non responsive, and gave terrible instructions. There was a minor hangup during install and could not reach the vendor and the company themselves gave me bad support as well.",GB,1,2017-12-17T10:28:42Z,procivic.com

I purchased a carbon fiber hood. The part looked and was shipped okay. After a day or two, I noticed a scratch under the clear coat. It is clearly a manufacture defect.

I immediately contacted the vendor because the manufacture does not provide contact information on their website. The vendor, Pro Civic, aka Pro Car Studios, refuses to send a hood in a good condition, without defects.

The reason it took a few days to notice is because the hood is textured and it can only be seen in sunlight and it especially stands out in certain angles. It cannot be seen under typical garage lighting.",US,1,2017-07-19T16:32:28Z,procivic.com

I'm Leo Nguyen, a customer from oversea. First of All, I would like to thanks Oscar for his great service and ProCivic. Their service is really helpful and reliable. They've consulted for me about the functions of each product, which is necessary and which is unnecessary for your car, when I chose a unnecessary item, they told me that was not necessary for your car, because I'm not an expert. Not like other shops they don't care about you, the more you buy, the more they happy. Moreover, they were ""Flexible"" in solving problem and ""Fast"" in every progress. I never use Paypal before, so they did not ask me to figure out how to use Paypal by myself, but they chose to call me directly through the phone to verify my credit card, so it make me feel convenience.

On this website, I had ordered some Koni shocks that said they were in stock, but turned out not to be. Naturally, I was irked.

The representative I talked to was immensely helpful and knowledgable; so much so that right there over the phone, I ordered a full set of KYB shocks that saved me $60 (I received a check in the mail for the difference only a day or two later) and, after a bit more research, were better for my specific application. The shocks shipped out and arrived right on time, packaged very safely. The KYB's fit perfectly, and perform very well!

14FB6,0.6,"This review is for my experience buying …

This review is for my experience buying the DC sports intake for the 14' Si. This is not the first purchase I have made from this site, having bought my q300 exhaust, and shift knob from this site before. In the past the products were excellent. Met all my expectations and satisfaction. This time however there were a few issues. The biggest one being that the instructions and some of the hardware provided were for earlier model year 9th gen civics. The crank ventilation and coolant hard lines for example were explained very poorly in the pictures as there were some variations in design from the earlier model years and my 2014 Civic. That being said the intake itself does not fit very well in the engine bay. It rattles against the firewall pulling off of a stop such as a red light. There is one metal plate there attatched with a 10mm bolt that I'm assuming was not on older 9th gens but on the 2014 it gets in the way. Lastly the bolt provided to thread onto the transmission does not thread on or fit whatsoever rendering the provided holding bracket useless. The intake shakes around even more so without it, being held on mainly by the coupler clamps. Also the instructions say to re use the OEM collapseable clamps for the new Crank Ventilation tube but they don't fit and none were provided with the kit. The coolant line however can re use the oem collapseable clamps. Lastly the quality of the finish on the intake was not the best. It was rough and does not seem like it would provide ultimate smooth airflow. Overall not 100% satisfied. The intake performs well but the hardware and instructions provided conflicted with my particular install.",GB,1,2017-04-27T22:20:00Z,procivic.com

Luke went above and beyond to help me out, first he figured out what we'd need to get the purchase verified, and then checked to see if their warehouse could ship to the address. After we hung up, he called my place of work to ensure that we could accept the delivery. I didn't even give him the phone number!

Overall I'm incredibly happy with the service I got from procivic/pro car studios. I will definitely be ordering from there again when I need more parts.",GB,1,2017-04-15T20:33:56Z,procivic.com

Nick Hopkins,0.2,"VERY DISAPPOINTED

Before we placed an order with procivic we did our research and saw the many great reviews. We were super disappointed after we placed our first order and the wrong part came. Took about a week and a half to 2 weeks to send back and get the correct part. Mistakes happen but we were fairly pleased with how everything was handled and the customer service. After that little mix up we decided to place a second order BIG MISTAKE!!!! We received the springs that were ordered in a timely fashion and they were correct! Excited to put them on the car we did but they were almost immediately taken off. Something about them just didnt fit right. Once again not a big deal, I am not new to the car world and know that things don't always go right the first time. Got in touch with pro civic, was told to send them back and they'd send them to the manufacturer to see what the issue was but that a refund would more then likely be ok. After going back and forth waiting for pro civic to get them and then for them to send back we were finally told that we could get a refund BUT they were going to charge us for the shipping to the manufacturer. Although i don't believe that is our problem in any way we were fine with that. Today i received an email stating that we were in fact NOT getting any refund and a picture of the 'damaged' springs which did NOT look like that when we placed them in the box to send back. I spent a lot of money on the springs only to send them back within the 30 day refund policy. Then was told they would give me a generous discount on a future order. We will NEVER order from this company again nor will i EVER refer anyone here. I know there is always going to be that ONE bad review but were talking about hundreds of dollars not being refunded.",US,1,2017-02-18T00:22:40Z,procivic.com

We put a front strut bar on and putting the cowl back on almost killed us. It was so easy to take off but putting it back on and getting everything back in place was hard.

For many years I have used pro civic to daydream of parts I would like to have for my vehicles. Well the day finally came where i was able to purchase a much needed part for my 2012 Honda Civic. I was amazed at how quickly the equipment arrived after ordering. And I was pleased to find that they called me (the cardholder) to verify that I was the one who had ordered or authorized the order of the parts before continuing. One of the main reasons I have chose this company for the part that was needed was the fact they are an authorized dealer for the equipment which is very important to me to ensure a quality part with a reliable warranty.

Clean little duck lip effect to it. A few minor scratches on it, but It doesn't matter. First purchase buying from ProCivic, but definitely not the last. Great product, 5 stars!",GB,1,2016-07-15T07:42:09Z,procivic.com

I ordered some Honda Civic JDM Type R emblems from Pro Civic. Obviously they were expensive, but that's how much they're really worth since they actually import them from Japan.

This shift knob is exactly as it is shown & described. Super easy to install & looks amazing in my civic.

I ordered an Injen Cold Air Intake from ProCivic recently. To start, the ProCivic team was incredibly helpful in answering my questions about different designs, hydro-lock, tuning, and anything else related to the selection of an intake. When I placed the order and had it sent to my work, they stopped the order but it was just to confirm that's where I really wanted it sent being an expensive item and a first time buy. This might annoy some people but frankly I appreciate the caution.

This was my first experience with this company, and there must be some real idiots that work there. I live in boise Idaho, and wanted my product shipped to bend Oregon for when I was over there because I had someone to install the product in my car for me. I payed for expidited shipment. Weeks later, I finally contacted them asking why they weren't there and they told me they needed confirmation in order to send it to an address that was not my billing address. Like Someone could do that by accident?!? They claim to have tried to contact me via phone but I have no voicemails or missed calls. The earliest they could send it to where I was was 5 days later. I said that was too late, I would be back in boise by then and to go ahead and send it to my home address. They also said that they would reimburse me for the amount of the expidited shipment fee since I was upset and it obviously didn't get there fast. After all this, they STILL shipped it to bend Oregon and they never reimbursed me for the expidited shipment fee. Now I am home in Boise Idaho and my product is sitting in bend Oregon...... I have to either drive all the way back to Oregon when I'm free next to get my product or have someone send it to me from there. I am extremely frustrated with this company.

Have ordered from them multiple times for multiple cars of mine here in Canada . Every time I've phoned customer services they have always been nice and helpful . Recently thou I ordered a hood for my car paid extra for shipping only to find out that they were out of stock . Only suggestion or downfall would be nice to have an update on the webpage whether and item is stocked or not .

My order had so much confusion and miss communication. I was basically charged almost $100 more than I was supposed to in the first place, all without my consent and was never notified of it until I went to my bank and checked my statements. Also, it took almost a week for them to even start to ship my order, they refunded my $26 for that but in my opinion was not enough. I am still waiting for my order to arrive and was told my ups it is going to take another week which would make it a total of about 2 weeks when I was told online and by phone it would be 3-8 days. Not impressed with the little communication they had to offer me, I have called to state my case and opinion and was told there is nothing they could do. I originally bought fro. Pro civic because it was the cheaper option that I had but in the end I ended up paying more and don't even know why.

I have been using PRO Civic for a few years now and have never had a problem with any orders or their Customer Service Team...

He gave me his professional & honest opinions on the shocks for my 2010 Civic Exl. He explained the spring tension numbers and ride height adjustments so I could understand them, he broke it all down into usable information. Thank you for your honesty & knowledge, Oscar.

I recently had my JDM red front emblem badly damaged from a rock. I knew I needed to buy a replacement but was unsure how to remove the damaged emblem. I called procivic and was given great instructions. I was also told to send an email to procivic's customer service to inquire about a possible discount. I sent an email and never received a response. I never expected a discount and actually received what I wanted from the phone call (removal instructions). But as a procivic customer, I was hoping for at least a response to the email. I purchased the new emblem and I will most likely be purchasing more items from procivic in the future.

Coilovers came to doorstep in beat up box. One coilover has severe bend in metal arm that, i believe, holds brake line. No biggy right ?

ALEXANDER,0.6,"Fairly Ok, but could use some improvements.

I ordered a set of Megan Street Series coilovers for my 2014 Si Coupe and then the next day I received a call to notify me that they were out of stock and on back order for the Megan coil for about a week. The website still showed that the item was not on back order. I also asked to put the item on hold and I was not told that it meant that I would have to pay for the item to be on hold, so my credit card was charged. I called and got clarification that ""On Hold"" meant that you are pretty much prepaying for the item and as soon as it comes back in stock you will have first dibs on the item and it will get shipped to you. A month later the Buddyclub camber kit came back in stock and I ordered that also. The same scenario happened again. ProCivic should have a better way of updating the out of stock items or back ordered items so that way the customers do not have their time wasted by ordering out of stock items.

Iv never ordered 3 items off a website at the same time and had 3 seperate delivery dates for each item. This is very annoying. I dont want to watch out for usps 3 times.

So im thinking they do not stock there own items or have there own warehouse and just order the parts from other places for you when you order off there site. Also Stop Tech website says they are made in canada but the rotor box said china on the white sticker label?? My fog lights box had a bunch of broken pieces of plastic in it.

I paid for a new NRG Anodized Magnetic Drain Plug for $23.82. What I received was a re-packaged used one. For a company that prides itself on ""100%"" customer satisfaction, this is pretty sad. The phillips head top is chipped and scratched from where someone tightened it with a screwdriver. I'm really not worried about the cost of the item as I was looking into buying the Buddy Club Racing Spec Coilovers in the next couple of months for my 2015 Civic Si Coupe and I am really glad I didn't. If this company is going to cheap out on me with a $23 dollar drain plug, who knows what I would have received if I had ordered a $1500 dollar set of coilovers.

Joshua Ursua,0.6,"Out of Stock

In my honest opinion, the customer service team has great feedback and people skills when dealing with their customers. I was contacted recently about some items that I was charged for and ordered, but were not in stock. The customer service team (the gentleman who called me the next day in particular) was very respectful polite and offered alternative solutions and even a better product at the same price. However the flywheel that was supposedly supposed to be sent with the short shifter did not arrive and was not on the shipping order. So currently I am still waiting for the clutch and shift knob (which will take a couple weeks as discussed over the phone) as well as the missing flywheel. My experience with personnel representing the customer service department was great enough to overlook the inconvenience, but a further more accurate review of the overall service is yet to come depending on how this whole ordeal plays out. With that being said, I have complete faith that PROcivic will do their best ensuring my order gets taken care of in the most prompt manner with the utmost care.",US,1,2015-07-08T00:32:54Z,procivic.com

I purchased an intake manifold from procivic. I emailed them to ask about a tracking number which I had not received after 3 days past purchase. They're response was ""we don't know yet. When we know, you'll know. Be patient."" I did not appreciate being told to ""be patient."" Procivic's shipping costs exceed almost every other online website that I've purchased from and is one of the slowest. The upside is that their prices are a tad lower than most.

By the reviews it seems there are plenty of satisfied customers but I was one of the few that receive negative experience with procivic.

I receive my item in a timely manner which I applaud them for fast shipping. But once I open the box and to my demise. The product was in poor condition plus I was missing several parts that I need to complete the installation.

I contacted Pro civic about my situation, informed that my order wasn't complete and send them pictures of the items. At the end, their best solution was to refer me to the manufacturer to handle my situation.

My knob wasn't exactly perfect but I am happy with it. And I didn't know that the leather (can't tell if it's fake but if it is, it's impressive for a replica!) wrap stitched around the knob was not centered. But upon looking at the pictures on the website, it didn't look centered either. Overall, I am happy with my purchase and I will continue to come back in the future for other upgrades",US,1,2015-04-22T04:38:59Z,procivic.com

I am both pleased and un pleased with my orders. When I placed my first order of a rear window visor, pro civic was quick about prices in my order and the packaging was great and although the shipping was rather expensive, I received my order promptly. My next order was a front type a lip and some side skirts and I must say that I was very unhappy when I received the front lip. It was bent and very badly shaped. When I contacted pro civic they were not in the mood to fix the problem but were more intent on me fixing my on problem so I had to force it into place and it does not looks as good as it should.

The product came on time and was exactly as advertised. Although the instructions on ProCivic's youtube channel do not exactly pertain to the coupe. In the coupe, there is no way to access the stock emblem in the rear from the trunk. The only access point is very small between the emblem and the trunk. You will have to break it off. I also have an issue with the front emblem not completely contacting on one side and will have to use some filler.

Josh,0.8,"Turnaround time is the most important thing to me

At Procivic.com, I like there website. It is very easy to navigate, there is nothing confusing about it, and their prices seem pretty competitive. I spoke to a customer service rep. a couple of times there, and they were very friendly and helpful. My only one complaint would be shipping time... Although it has been THAT long, today is 9/25/14 and my order was placed on 9/17/14. I have been asked to write reviews for companies in the past, and I cannot stress to them enough, about how very important the shipping times are. As a consumer, we are shopping on ProCivic because we are excited about upgrading our cars! Who wants to wait days and even weeks for their new mods to show up? This is the one aspect that would not only improve their business, but it would promote more business and business more often. Had I already received my parts, I would have made my next order already, but because I am still waiting, I haven't. This, in my opinion, is an easy fix. Process orders and ship them the same day, and spend a few extra bucks to get it to the customer faster. That's it. If I ordered from them, and received my goods in 2 days, I would be talking about that. I wouldn't be saying to a friend who is asking me about my suspension parts, ""No, I am still waiting for them to show up."" Sorry to ramble on here, but as you can see, shipping times are the most important thing to me. So many more products would be ordered from them, if the products arrived faster. Otherwise, great customer service and great website.",US,1,2014-09-25T18:01:27Z,procivic.com

Christopher Kelly,1.0,"Great company. Sadly one hiccup.

I ordered two products from Procivic a little over a week ago. I received an email update with the tracking number and a rough ETA. When they arrived I received one package not two as expected so when I opened it I had only received one product, the fog lights, and not the grill. I waited one day in case maybe the other package was left on the truck or in the warehouse on accident. When I got no package I called UPS and received notification that only one package was meant to be delivered and that it was. I then called Procivic customer support and reported my problem just to verify that it was shipped. The staff I spoke to (forgot his name) said he would go to the warehouse to see what happened. A few hours later he got back in contact with me and told me that they were out of stock on the specific product, Type R Grill, and that they had replaced it with a similar style but hasn't uploaded it up on the site. He gave me a few options to correct what happened. He said he could either refund me both the product price and the shipping price, or he could send me the new grill as a replacement for what I paid for. But without an image to see how it looked I opted to get the refund which went through the next day. One problem is the fact that there's no installation instructions for the fog lights so my friend and I have had to look up DIY guides and wiring diagrams on other fog light brands and had to apply it to these Pro Design OEM style lights.

Overall it was a great experience with this company and I would recommend it again any time due to the great prices, good shipping times (could be shorter but there's limits to ground shipping), and a very helpful customer support staff.

Thanks Procivic for the product and the very fast resolution to a problem. Some companies would either ignore the request or take their own sweet time resolving something like a missing product.",US,1,2014-08-21T16:22:04Z,procivic.com

The intake made the car sound and run better, but the parts that came with it did not fit, resulting in me having to go buy the correct parts myself at Auto Zone to even install it. The hose clamps were too small, and the bolt that goes into the side of the intake tube to keep it stabilized was too big. I have not been able to find a bolt that will fit this, so I'm currently up the creek without a paddle in regards to that matter. Overall, I'm displeased.",US,1,2014-07-10T01:36:27Z,procivic.com

In February I bought a 99 Civic EX Coupe. It had been lowered (correctly) but just sat too damn low for me.

Had a very good purchasing experience with you guys. Customer service was great and answered my questions promptly. Happy that you gave the discount on my purchase for being part of the 8th civic forums where I found the product first advertised. Slightly dissatisfied with the shipping conditions of my parts. A small metal piece of the throttle body was broken off, probably during shipping, which I found inside the box. It doesn't appear that it will affect the operation of the part in anyway, but a little more cushioning in the package might have prevented this. The throttle body was sitting loose in the box as it was only packed with 1 piece of heavy duty type shipping paper.

Jason ko,1.0,"A profound customer experience!

After purchasing coil overs for my Si from this site, I never would of even thought that pro civic would actually call me and notify me of shipment statuses and whatnot...it is a totally different online shopping experience indeed! i felt much more at ease with my order and i definitely felt a more personal experience shopping with pro civic. They even explained to me with their found knowledge of the product when i doubted the extra fees it would cost me to install it at an auto shop. I think that many of other sites should acknowledge and follow pro civics customer experience as an example of a greater shopping experience rather than using an automated process. I would most definitely recommend this site to anyone out there, Thank you and your service is greatly appreciated, Pro Civic!",US,1,2014-04-24T00:30:59Z,procivic.com

I buy a pair of headlights for my 2007 Civic, then the next day I get an email asking for me to call them. When I do call them they tell me the headlights I ordered are on backorder and says I can order a different pair and then recommends a pair that I ultimately order. No problem. THEN, two days later I get another email asking me to call them. They tell me that THOSE headlights are on backorder and ask if there is a DIFFERENT pair I would like, I pick some and then the representative says ""Let me call the warehouse and make sure."" (Why didn't they do this the first time?) When he calls me back, he informs me that Pro Civic has ZERO headlights for my civic, apologizes, and gives me a $10 coupon (as if I'll be shopping there again.)

I'd like to start by saying that your website is incredibly easy to follow for getting the correct parts for whatever Civic you have. It's so well organized and simple to understand.

And I wanted to share what a pleasant experience I had with your company. I ordered the rear window spoiler for my 2012 Civic Si a couple of months ago. It was on backorder, but that wasn't any fault of yours. I deal with third party vendors every day at my work, and realize you can't always control delivery. What impressed me the most was the interactions I had with Adam. I probably heard from him four or five times while waiting for delivery. EVERYTIME, he was apologetic about not having the item in stock, but assured me that I would get one as soon as it arrived, and kept me updated with expected arrival. After much anticipation, I finally got the spoiler and installed it. It looks fantastic and fitment was perfect (always a concern with aftermarket parts).

In a world where many companies take for granted the customers they have, it was refreshing to deal with a company that was so pro-active in contacting their customers. I was very impressed, and you have earned a customer for as long as I have my car.",US,1,2013-08-27T03:05:12Z,procivic.com

Pro Civic is undoubtedly the best business with whom I have had the pleasure to interact. They further discounted the already competitively priced items I ordered and followed up at every point along the way until delivery to the Ogdensburg, NY UPS Store.",CA,6,2013-08-01T14:29:24Z,procivic.com

I ordered a a full suspension upgrade and brake kit, Pro Civic had all parts for my car with very competitive pricing. They gave me exceptional customer service and very fast delivery.

Rob And,0.8,"Customer service is up there, but they need to update stock on website.

I buy most of my parts here, and customer service is awesome. On your first order they make sure the credit card is under your name, something I wish every site would do. They also called to let me know when something wasn't in stock, but I honestly wish they would have it on their website. That's not really a big issue though. I think my biggest problem was, with one of my orders, my Megan coilovers took forever to come and I got no response from anyone at all. Rubbed me the wrong way for a little while but they have been on point every other time. I just got in my torque damper and it came in on time with no problems. All in all this place is pretty good.",US,1,2013-07-29T22:00:28Z,procivic.com

Dennis Morales,1.0,"Best Customer service seen in years...

From the moment I made the decision to purchase my items to the moment I received them, the customer service acted flawlessly. The one thing that I considered most important was the confirmation of my purchase before it was even sent to the warehouse for processing and before it was properly deducted from my financial institution, so you can feel at rest and not to be concerned with fraud or for anyone using an unauthorized credit card.",US,3,2013-07-14T11:53:00Z,procivic.com
Nathaniel Richards,1.0,"High quality parts and excellent service.

All the parts I've purchased are as-advertised on the site. The website is comprehensive and easy to navigate. The staff is professional and very knowledgeable about whether a specific part will fit your specific model, or how a new part might work with upgrades that have already been made. Anyone thinking about upgrading their Civic should check out PRO Civic.",US,1,2013-07-12T21:18:51Z,procivic.com
Kevin Lynn,1.0,"Taking the Upgrade Plunge, In Excellent Style!

This is truly my first purchase to upgrade parts on my Civic. I figured this would be the go-to spot for parts after scouring prices and selection all across the internet. Usually I'm hesitant to put blind faith in total online shopping, but I did it here and couldn't be happier. No confusions or hidden fees or surprises...just an honest shopping experience. I do wish there were more user reviews available for parts, as a new tuner, I share some trepidation at picking a wrong part....but then again, I understand that's not exactly something PROCivic can control (since users contribute).
I even screwed up on my checkout and put my shipping address as my billing address, so my bank denied the transaction. I got both a call and an email letting me know of the issue and how to call back. The service rep I spoke to on a few occasions was very understanding and took his time with me, something I don't see much of lately. They'll definitely be seeing more orders from me!",US,1,2013-07-11T04:59:41Z,procivic.com

I ordered a part for my Honda civic from ProCivic.com and i received the email confirmation of the order immediately. But the next business day i received a phone call from the company saying they were out of the part and would send it out asap. At least they called to tell me it would be a little late instead of me wondering what the hell was going on.",US,1,2013-07-05T01:02:43Z,procivic.com

Michael Abboud,1.0,"Customer service at its finest!

In all honesty, the only reason I would make a purchase from a local specialist is to save a couple of dollars on custom brokers and duty fees. On the other hand, I would recomend ProCivic to anyone looking for civic parts because of their exellent customer service (v.i.a e-mail or over the phone) from the fact that they are knowledgable and extremely polite. For these reasons, I personally continue to be a customer in hopes that one day my civic can be unique.",US,1,2013-07-03T05:30:30Z,procivic.com
