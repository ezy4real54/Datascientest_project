duke,0.2,"We need more in person sites again

I should've ✔ the reviews before doing this pre licensing course. I ordered the course on the 11th of this month and watching some of the reviews for this year I see others had the same issues as well. This is a company verified by dmv but this is the second website I have used and i am starting to realize they are basically taking advantage of this based on its online and they are behind the scenes. They get all your personal information because you don't have to go into a office setting. I finished and wasted a whole day doing this course to have them say its nothing they can do to override the verification process and did not hesitate to refund me my money. Any other company would find a way to make things right with they customers these ppl are a scam just like the it other company I used how can I go thru this two times with different companies. So now i gave my personal information to ppl that probably wouldn't hesitate to use it. Be careful with these websites that don't try to make things right for their customers.",US,1,2022-08-15T18:41:52Z,iDriveSafely

As much I hated having to take this blasted course, I have to say that I actually did learn a couple things, and was reminded of a few basic things that I really already knew, but maybe did not necessarily think about very much. (When maybe I need to think about it more often, if that makes sense.)
There were a couple of times where it was possible to become confused, because there was the necessity of having to remember too many numbers; feet etc.

In fact, I have taken a few screen shots to share with people that I know so they recognize their safety for others shortcomings while driving.",US,1,2022-07-24T21:49:16Z,iDriveSafely

Considering that this test is designed for ""mature"" drivers, my suggestion would be to have more tests that cover less material per test. I found myself sometimes a bit overwhelmed with the amount of statistics and variety of material before being tested. Worrying that you won't remember the potential question on the many statistics causes one to become anxious and therefore not retain the more important points of each section. It is interesting, however, that the final section was the most difficult for me and I scored 100% which made me feel it was worth the extra time I gave each section.",US,1,2022-07-24T03:18:38Z,iDriveSafely

I had to take a traffic school course and provide a certificate to the court, however I never received one!

Once the company obtained my card information, the charges kept occurring on my account, they aggressively sign you up for some unknown services, so I had to call my bank and block my card!

After hours on the phone with customer service reps, I’ve been told that apparently I’ve put those requests myself that’s why those charges showed up 😂 Their rebuttal sentence: “You have put the request yourself, that’s why there’s a charge”,”You registered the second account and paid again”,”You’ve called in and requested for this and that…”

I pulled out other clients feedbacks and many unhappy customers were, apparently, signed up for services they never requested for

I reported website to the federal consumer protection as well as looking to take legal action against it!

Please, do not give them you card number, they are scammers and fraudsters! Better pay for your traffic ticket or just take a course at your local traffic school, more hustle but SAFE!",CA,1,2022-07-15T21:14:04Z,iDriveSafely

Do not use this online course!!! A few things:
1) It is not a fast course, 6-8 hours guaranteed. Don’t trust the review that say fast and easy. Lies
2) After 7 hours of doing this test, never even got the chance to answer any questions on the final. I had to pause in the test and it automatically failed me.

This test is not too bad, but why ask questions that are not even in the reading material? Don't you think that's wrong? Grant it this time I got one question wrong because it wasn't in the reading material, but in this day and age having a video camera is preferable to pen and paper, it's more accurate.
Also, when asking for help by e mailing your so-called help, well I got no help. I asked why I couldn't go back to review the chapters; you are allowed to do this but the response I got had nothing to do with my question. I found this annoying, so I could not review the chapters, I don't know if I will do your test again, if you don't fix your problems and get people who understand the American language.

I am taking drivers ed right now and I'm very satisfied with my experience. It is not perfect, however.

The learning objectives is always correct and matching up with the actual lesson. The review, however, always has things not covered in the lesson, or lacking things covered in the lesson.
My theory is the lessons differ from state to state but the generalized lesson for the entire country doesn't match up or something.

After you pay the $25, you can't even register for the course. And you keep getting the robot telling you to try different things, none of which work. Total, total, total scam.

Updated—— the service was perfect. When I arrived at the road test site the person there already had my info in system. Just bring ur printed completion paper, I had that and was all good. Didn’t get result for road test until about 7pm and tested at 930am. This is a great service.


I will consider changing my rating if I can get some clarity on the process from the company. I signed up for and completed my NY State Pre License course. The course itself was well run and the verifications were no problem at all. I would give the program 5/5 with the ability to do this at home at own pace online. HERE IS THE PROBLEM THOUGH-- Upon completion I received an email stating that I have passed. It definitely does take alot of time, so I was excited to be finished and figured I would easily be on my way to schedule road test. I went to the DMV website to schedule my road test. They REQUIRE a certificate # in order to schedule the appointment. There is NO CERTIICATE # PROVIDED on the completion email. It simply says that IDRIVESAFELY will notify the DMV within 24-48 hrs. Now even when they notify the DMV, I will need a certificate # in order to schedule this appointment. There is no way around it. How do I get my certiicate # and schedule an appointment for road test? What is the protocol in NY State if the customer servce rep I spoke with says "" they dont issue certificatein NY"". The company was listed on the DMV website as approved as well, so you wish this was done with more clarity. I hope to hear back from the company and if this situation is rectified I would happily change my rating. The low rating is based solely on the lack of certificate # which I need to proceed. PS- why did they enroll me in Road side assistance for $5 p/mo on the low. That was pretty sneaky.",US,1,2022-05-13T03:06:35Z,iDriveSafely

This is a practical, common sense course that educates without resorting to “gotcha” test questions that serve no real training purpose.

I Drive Safely is such an amazing program! I'm currently a student and I've had my permit now for about a year, but this program really covers EVERYTHING you need to know, plus extra. The only thing I don't necessarily like, that is out of my control, is the time. They say at the beginning that this is just to make sure everyone is getting the same required time and that you don't skip over. I'm a fast reader so I pretty much always have time left over but I decided to take notes to by pass the time! 100% recommend!!",US,2,2022-04-15T20:37:24Z,iDriveSafely

Morris,0.2,"Waste of time and money

The Florida Mature Driver Safety Course is very outdated. It uses data from 2005. This is 2022. After two attempts I can't pass the 50-question final exam. I have been driving 58 years and never had an accident that was my fault. (I have been rear-ended twice in the last 20 years.) I consider myself a very safe driver and could have taught the course. I don't drive on snow/ice or through deep water.

The RV section is not applicable to me. I don't have a RV, never drove one, don't plan to. I don't have a trailer hitch on my car and don't tow anything, such as a camper. I drive less than 8,000 miles a year, mainly to doctor appointments.

The iDriveSafely course was mostly as expected. I was surprised that most of the statistics come from 2011--and it is 2022. They really should proof their materials better. One or 2 questions in Test 1 were not discussed until the following chapter. That happened more than once throughout the course. Also, I think asking questions on the test about good driving strategies rather than numbers or statistics is a better measure of what people actually should learn and remember. The statistics make a point, but the strategies offered provide techniques that I can use everyday to be a better driver. You want ""learners"" to read the information and remember and employ the strategies that actually help people perform better on the streets and highways.",US,2,2022-02-02T22:16:57Z,iDriveSafely

This is a pretty thorough course. Take notes, and take time to be able to pay attention to the information. It is not something to do in 5 minutes. It will feel a little long winded sometimes, but overall, they include a lot of information that can be used for refreshing ones memory, and learn new things as well. Wish it could count towards continuing education. I spent quite a few hours working on this to pass the quiz's and final test. !00% and hoping it counts towards safer driving and a discount on my insurance!",US,3,2021-12-31T03:49:20Z,iDriveSafely

The completion certificate they say is available within 24 IS NOT! I have emailed customer support over 10 times, and included screen shots of my completed course. They continued to fail to answer any of the questions I actually asked, and gave me generic info, that I had already mentioned trying. They caused me to miss my deadline, and have stopped responding to my requests where I noted the $20 refund was insufficient since they could not allow me to access any materials I needed, and I spent countless hours completing the course.

KAREN LUM,0.8,"A Most Satisfying Mature Driver's Course

The online course was fun to go through, and I learned a lot by getting a refresher on driving safety, new vehicle technologies, and more. I felt the course content was thorough and adequately covered.

I only have three complaints. First, I am able to read and digest information fast, but was frustrated by the timers imposed on each unit or segment that prevented me from progressing through the entire course more quickly. I know that ""I Drive Safely"" is not responsible for that given federal regulations on the three-hour requirement for such courses. Nevertheless, it was frustrating for me. However, the positive is that it gave me time to get a cup of coffee or to review any information more carefully. The second complaint has to do with the wrong landing page for reviewing incorrect quiz answers. As for the latter, you can review what you got wrong, but sometimes you are shown a page that does not match what you got wrong. The final complaint is that much of the traffic data is from 2011, which makes me wonder about how often the course is updated to reflect current information (unless this is typical of all online courses).

Overall, I enjoyed taking the course and would recommend it to others. The course is reasonably priced, especially for repeat customers. There is also a discount for future courses, which is nice. I look forward to continuing my mature driver's discount with our insurer.",US,2,2021-12-03T02:39:46Z,iDriveSafely

I was advised to take this course prior to going to court. The course asks you why you are taking it but there is no information on why this is needed. Turns out I was supposed to check court-ordered, then it starts out asking questions on what I was convicted on. Well I wasn't convicted because I didn't go to court yet. So I selected 5 safe points, really didn't want my traffic data being stored and sent to others anyway.

I kept on picking wrong answer and it kept on repeating the same video. I have watched the same video 4 times and still haven’t been able to guess the correct answer. I called the company and got a recording saying I called during off business hours. Well, I called at 2:00pm California time. Not sure what their office time is.

The program is great and super easy! Learned a few things and it was fun to do! Super long as expected. One issue I had was that they did not have an option to send it to the court house. I paid for an expedited copy but I thought that meant it would be sent to my house. Does not specify that it does not. So I called and emailed about how it can get sent to me. They explained that it would be an additional $10 fee for it to be printed out and sent to me. So I asked if I can use the expedited amount to put towards that because al they did is post it on my IDriveSafe account. And they said no... but what I don't get is why they make you pay money for it to be a picture to be expedited if they can't just send it. Customer service was terrible.

Joe Pambianco,0.2,"Deceptive: Defaults to recurring charge for unwanted service

The super slow timer for each section is terrible but worse yet, somewhere in the process they defaulted me into buying recurring $5 a month roadside assistance. I wasn't aware that I signed up for it and never wanted or used it. I wouldn't even now how to if I wanted to. My wife told me that I've been paying them for months for a service that I NEVER wanted and didn't know I had. When I took on the project of cancelling, I first called their customer service at 10am pacific time and it went to voicemail. Clearly they are counting on people to not get around to cancelling or putting it off when it isn't easy to find how to cancel. I am sure they can point to the place where some screen I clicked through had an option to opt out, but it's clearly their business plan to sell people indefinitely a service that they don't consciously choose. Deceptive and unethical. Yuck! Edit: They replied below to clarify how their intentionally deceptive sign up process works. I got curious to see if I could actually use the roadside service. Turns out I would have to find the roadside assistance phone # then find an email they say they sent me to find my id#. This assumes I even know I have the service. Almost pure profit for them because almost no roadside service actually provided (and surely farmed out if someone figures out they have it and use it).

It is well-designed and easy to manage, though if one is a slow reader (which I am not) the video version might be the preferred way. The info is clear and prompts one to review one's driving habits. My only complaint, and it is minor, is that sometimes you have to wait to be able to move on even if you are done or if the content is not relevant.",US,1,2021-08-06T01:02:59Z,iDriveSafely

Bryan Baranski,0.4,"It's 2021.... But Locked out for not completing by due date of 08-10-2010

I received my first speeding ticket in at least 10 year in June 2021, I paid the ticket and the case was resolved.. Easy enough.
But, 10 day later I received A letter from The Michigan Department of State Information Center telling me I could midigate the effects of the citation through the Michigan's Basic Driver Improvement Course (BDIC) Program.
By successful completing the BDIC Program I would not have any points added to my driving record and they would also not disclose the situation to my insurance company.

So I looked into the options provided in the letter and eventually chose to registered for the Michigan Basic Driver Improvement Course offered by I Drive Safely, and made plans to get the work completed by the Deadline provided in my letter, it states complete the program no later then 11:59pm 08-10-2021.
So, today is 08-04-2021 and it was time to get to work. I logged into the program, and started the course. I finished Level 1 Chapter 1.. easy enough then I completed Level 2 Chapter 1, moving along well. Next I click to launch Level 2 Chapter 2 and this error message popped up.
""Course locked
Per state regulations, your course has expired because your court deadline date has passed. We will report this course to the state as ""failed.""
Then I notice something strange in the course heading area which said ""Michigan Basic Driver Improvement Course
15% course complete
Complete by: 08/10/2010
Course overview""
What?! Complete by: 08/10/2010 !?
I am not sure what the remedy will be, but I hope I Drive Safely corrects this obvious technical issue, quickly, and without me fighting them over it.
I have six children, a full time college student, and worker. I don't want this to become a thing, please rectify the situation, that's all I am hoping for now.

***Update*** 08/04/2021
A Customer Experience Hero from I Drive Safely, Skylar D. Looked into my situation and it indeed was set to expire 08-10-2010 (my fault when registering I’m sure) and corrected the complete by date to 08-10-2021. I received a nice email informing me of the findings, and that I could now continue my course where I left off.
I appreciate the speedy response and commend the ease of resolving this issue, no run around or guilt trips, just simply corrected.

Thank you,

Not to mention if you don't remember a little detail of a 15 min video asking you how many lights someone ran before crashing and get the answer wrong, you have to watch it again to figure it out, only to end the video with a different question that is just as dumb to even remember.......

So before you know it, you've spent 45 mins re-watching a video over and over again because you can't just find that part with the info you needed..

Good news and bad news. The good: I found this course to be helpful and instructive and would comfortably recommend it.

(And yes, this would be true even for slow readers...); and 2) A personal pet peeve, grammar and punctuation and spelling errors (not a huge number, but I think a company of this size could be more attentive to these details).",US,1,2021-04-19T01:42:06Z,iDriveSafely

I took the SafeWayDriving course fpr teens by mistake; whad to take the one to get a ticket dismissed. There are a couple significant differences between the two courses; 1) the teens course suggests a way to get out of a skid is to ""find a target, foot off gas/brake, steer to target"" the instructor says ""steering in the direction of the skid"" will get you in trouble. The other course I took to get a ticket dismissed recommended the ""steer in the direction of the skid"" method. Also, teens course has a chart with alcohol absorption differences between males and females; there are significant differences.

I liked the layout of the page as it was very intuitive to navigate through the course, and the videos were quite useful, especially the ones that showed me how to prevent accidents and what to do in case of one.

But there are three problems: first, the video and the time required to move to the next section were not synchronized, sometimes I had to wait 30 seconds and another 3 minutes; Although it is not a big problem, it interferes with the flow of the course and can end up being a bit inconvenient. Secondly, it is extremely easy to get distracted from the videos, it would be nice if they put little activities between videos to make sure that we pay attention to the lesson both to the answers and to a mini-test, or that the video is paused when you are in another tab. third, ALL THE ANSWERS TO THE EXAMS ARE ON THE INTERNET, ALL OF THEM! must include an anti-cheat system",US,1,2021-02-25T04:23:40Z,iDriveSafely

This course is excellent in informing and educating people about crucial information that I had no idea about. This course did a great job to better help me understand rules of the road such that it is illegal to speed up as somebody is passing you while driving. I did not know that before taking this course. It also taught me valuable lessons to help maintain my own car such that breaking while turning can impose a greater wear and tear on your tires as opposed to breaking before turning your car. This course also does a great job of explaining the importance and responsibilities that come along with driving and encouraging good decisions such as not drinking and driving through providing a moving testimonial story of a daughter who was killed as a result of a man's drunk driving. There course should be expanded into high school and maybe even middle school classrooms to make sure the younger generation is learning all of this information that I and a lot of my fellow peers never learned.",US,2,2021-02-22T03:07:20Z,iDriveSafely

GREGORY HARDY,0.4,"Free certificate delivery options are hidden until after you pass the course.

Certificate delivery options are over-priced. Upon purchasing the course, there was no option for free electronic delivery of my certificate. You could, however, buy an electronic certificate delivery which was the most expensive option. Then after taking the course, they present to you another opportunity to purchase an expedited certificate. If you decline, as I did, and elect to use the slowest delivery method, which was the ""only free option"" the website loads a new page where you are given the option to download a free electronic certificate. Interestingly, the option to go back to the previous page is disabled and the slow-but-free option and the suddenly-free-electronic-certificate option, are your only two options. The reason for this dishonest business practice is obvious: they want you to spend more money! If you refuse, they realize they can save money by not sending you a printed certificate at all. But since they know that electronic delivery will be the most popular option for the customer, they try diligently to charge you for it. Only after you have elected three times to accept snail mail as your only free option do they then offer you free electronic delivery. Don't be fooled into purchasing something that costs them nothing. Refuse to pay, and then, they will cave in and offer you the free electronic delivery to save themselves the shipping costs.",US,1,2021-01-16T06:30:32Z,iDriveSafely

I Drive Safely is a wonderful tool to help you pass your written driver's test when you go to the DMV. It is extremely comprehensive and thorough and goes over every detail concerning the Driver's Education Handbook for California. I have taken the course twice now and passed both times. One great feature of the course is that you can log out whenever you wish and then log back in again. One additional feature that is awesome is that there is also a great quiz at the end of each section before one takes the final exam.

I was startled to appreciate how much I learned about the consequences of unsafe driving. The real life stories are sober reminders and the deep/broad lessons are cemented in my brain. The depth of new knowledge one can gain from this program is far greater than I thought. Even the cartoon characters play a role in keeping one focused!
While I subscribed to this course to mitigate more serious impact to my driver's license, what I came away with was a far better understanding of how to improve my driving at age 82. Thank You.",US,1,2020-12-21T16:57:20Z,iDriveSafely

Once I began to take ownership for what I had created and concentrated on the course at hand all of life became simple including this class.
I learned that I hadn’t been valueing my life nor those around me this class has shown me the importance of slowing down and considering life via different set of eyes.

Anne,0.8,"I feel that Idrivesafely strived to teach me good driving habits but strayed once in a great while into relevant minutia.

I feel that Idrivesafely strived to teach people like me responsible, good, safe driving habits. What I also feel is that the course fell into the same problem that every good, well-intention course these days fall into - floods the learner with facts, figures, information, formal writing/speaking, words overly elegant and smart-sounding, and floods the learner with information. What I want and need is information about how to drive safely that I will remember three months, six months, one year, two years from now.....so concentrating on 'the bones' in as simple and declarative a way as possible to me seems to make sense. Your course does that to a good extent, but has more ""icing on the cake"" that I would want, if that makes any sense. But I might be wrong. Why test me on the accidental deaths in 2011? Why not more on the best way to deal with speeding drivers on the highway? Or drivers cutting around on city streets? or something more down to earth? How about, what do you do when you see a drunk driver ahead of you on a two-lane road? Make sure I know what I am doing when I get behind the wheel and please don't make me nervous about whether I should remember every little ""fact"" or term brought up in the discussion. That is what would make a better driver, I believe. Thank you for asking my opinion. You are definitely on the right track.",US,3,2020-12-01T22:41:05Z,iDriveSafely

Abstract MattR,0.8,"A+ Adult driving course

A+ Adult driving course. Website is simple to navigate. The course content and quizzes were easy to complete and pass. Received a downloadable/printable certification immediately after completing course. The ONLY reason NOT 5 STARS is because on MacBook the program won’t work with Safari soo I had to download Google Chrome just to do the course, and then uninstall afterwards. Was a bit frustrating trying to figure out why it kept repeating the first course video over and over until I found the browser requirements in the help section. Other than that, I highly recommend!

The minimum time limit led me to actually reading what I was supposed to read. The idea of short unit questions and quizzes is nicer than a single final exam. In reality, it was very nice.

KAREN LEMAY,1.0,"Had a wreck and needed defensive driving to cut down the fine costs

I had a wreck and my find was huge. To cut this in half I decided to take defensive driving. When I logged on to this course it was extremely easy to follow the instructions. What I liked most was that I could easily get in and out of it without time consuming searches. Another awesome aspect was that if I answered too many questions incorrectly, it would let me go through the section again until I could answer enough correct to pass. it was a pain sometime having to go through the entire section again but it gave me the opportunity to garner the information needed to pass the test for that section. On a personal level, I continue to think of some of the discussion during certain sections and I am using these suggestions to drive safely. I have been very nervous driving since I had the wreck but I feel more confident and aware since I took this course. I received my certificate immediately upon completion of the course and printed it off and saved it to my computer. I had not planned on getting my driving record through them because I did not want to pay the $20. But upon completion of the course I changed my mind. Having them get my driving record for me just took away so much stress and worry. And, by the time I printed off my course completion certificate and logged into my gmail account, my driving record was already emailed to me. i highly recommend this course for anyone. There was no hidden cost and I had the option to just read the pages or watch videos and since I was completing it at work I just read the pages and printed out the review pages when instructed to. There were a couple videos I had to watch but they had a transcript with each video. I give this course and the experience a 100% thumbs up. If you have to take the course, I recommend this one.",US,1,2020-11-16T21:33:42Z,iDriveSafely

You can write a review if you’ve had a recent, genuine experience.

Reviews are your chance to share your experiences with others and give feedback to companies. Size doesn’t matter here, we think all experiences big and small are worth reviewing — whether it’s a phone call, an online order, a visit to your local store or otherwise using a company’s products or service.

Just keep it fresh by writing about your experience that happened in the past 12 months. While your story about buying a boombox in the 80s is cool, it’s less relevant for consumers looking to invest in today’s hi-tech audio products. When you share your recent experiences, other readers get a feel for how a company is operating now. And companies get valuable up-to-date feedback",US,1,2020-11-12T17:59:45Z,iDriveSafely

The quizzes were good as a way to know you’re learning from the chapters before you proceed to the next one. My complaint is that some videos end but the timer doesn’t so I’m forced to let the timer go down before I can proceed to the next video/topic which can be about 3-2 minutes of waiting.

Good test, alot of information to absorb. I do not think they had to go into all the mechanics information regarding suspension systems and tires.

It would of been better for them to offer you another action. I have driven in blinding snowstorms because I did not have a choice.

I took and completed an iDriveSafely course a few weeks later in October hoping to raise the points of my traffic ticket that I went to court a few weeks earlier for. I paid my ticket early in the month and was expecting my points to go from a +2 to a -1. Knowing that in the sate of VA ever drivers clinic course adds +5 to your driving record I was expecting it to be raised to a +4 to help me out. Well what ACTUALLY happened is iDriveSafely decided to submit my points EARLIER to the DMV before the court submitted their adjudication and it raised my points from a +2 to a +5 only for it to get lowered back down to a +2 again. I mean what was the point in paying you guys. So I contact their customer service and they said I need to talk to the DMV. Well anyone who knows the DMV can probably guess how that went down. They said too bad nothing we can do about it. So I wasted my money on these guys and did not get what I expected to get.

I was driving to Lufkin a long drive from Ft Worth. I like driving early to my destinations especially long distances. It was dark and sometimes it is hard to see speeding signs when you are looking for unexpected wild game passing across your path. Well came to a small town unexpected the speed sign went to 75mph to 55mph did not see that rapid change so was stopped for speeding. I slowed but not fast enough. If the speed signs are more florescent (green) like some school signs in Dallas it is an eye catcher especially approacing small country towns and their speed limits.

John,0.6,"How to make a long course longer.

It had a lot of information and many good ideas how to drive safely. They are very helpful. However, I thought the course was overly long. True, I am a slow reader (though I read a lot of books in my leisure time), but it took me over 12 hours to get through. There was a lot of extraneous information as far as I was concerned. For example there was a section on traveling with children not having to do with safety concerns (how to keep them occupied during a long trip). Also pets, how to rent a car, etc. What does this have to do with a safety course? It makes a long course unnecessarily longer. Also the course I took was produced in 2012, making its (unnecessary) technology review outdfated.",US,3,2020-10-15T18:25:48Z,iDriveSafely

This course re-affirmed my driving ability. No tickets or accidents since 1993! But as a 70+ driver and driving a 45 foot motor home towing a Jeep I felt a course was worth while. The express way section was helpful in that it explained why so many drivers are dis-courteous and even impaired during rush hour! Also the section dealing with tailgaters was certainly needed for todays drivers - everyone is in a hurry! Having statistic questions in the final exam isn’t necessary in my opinion, especially since the stats are from 2011-2012, not current! Over all I rated the course a 4 star.

The course went over everything from rules of the road, to how to handle yourself in an accident, to how to drive anything from a car to an RV and trailer. The only thing I had a problem with was the time limits. For each passage of information there was a time limit varying from 1:00 (minute) to 10:30. They were very extensive and unnecessary. I dont disagree with the allowance of time limits, however, they were way too long. The passages with a 10 minute wait time only took maybe 2-4 minutes to read.

I took this test to get a deduction on my car insurance.

I could take my time and go at my own pace and I liked that I could stop and come back to the on line class anytime. It was a lot of reading and it took longer than I thought it would, but it was best for me to finish each module and take the quiz right after while everything was still fresh in my mind. Some of the statistics were a bit much to remember all those numbers but overall it was very informative and I find I watch how I drive much more now. Easy to follow the flow of the modules. All went very smoothly and i didn't have any issues.

It was kind of like being at the movies
Read, listen, watch, eat popcorn lol

Voice was very easy to follow hear and understand.

The break down of each session seemed categorized.
Which makes learning the rules of our road system, laws and other information very easy .

I liked some of videos as I learned information I did not know. Which when driving today was very useful.
For me this was not just about having a court order to complete this course. I learned how to become a better driver. I did not realize how much I was not attentive to road rules.

I answered wrong and had to watch the whole thing again. That's 16 minutes at the end of the course which I did not feel like doing. I tried to do the score comparison and the site shut down.

The ""I Drive Safely"" online course was very comprehensive and covered quite a bit of content. Each page was timed, which I think is ultimately good and makes sure the student is staying on the page and reading the content.
I would suggest two improvements....
1.) Update the data in the program. It's not that it's not accurate, its' just that it's 12 years old....based on data from 2008.
2.) There were several pages where videos were available to watch....but the video might run for 35 sconds or 1 minute...but the required time on the page runs much longer than the video...so time is lost for the student waiting to advance to the next page.
3.) The program is advertised as ""Fully Online""....although that is technically true...there should be more upfront explanation that the student must go to a testing center to take the final exam. That was a surprise once I got in the program. It was a pretty easy experience and the UPS Store was very helpful...even though the test is also ""online""....it's not like you can take the entire course and test at home.
All that said, I WOULD recommend this program to others.",US,1,2020-08-12T19:57:33Z,iDriveSafely

A week after I had completed the course I was expecting the certificate of completion that never arrived. I decided to contact the company about it and they told me due to covid 19 the printing location was closed down temporarily. However he has been a month and a 1/2 and I still have not received my certificate and all they can tell me is to make sure that my address is correct but no one can tell me if he has even been printed.

It's a good course. Very informative and educational. And not hard to do at all. BUT it's also very thorough and detailed. And theres a lot of talking and content (and) in some videos very boring!! I know a lot of reviewers say it keeps you from being bored so I guess it depends on the person. But for me I have mild to moderate ADD so I suppose that's why it gets too much for me. But I've been through many classes, meetings and seminars and they seem a lot less tedious than some of the videos in this course. There are some videos though that I felt were great! They helped more than the others. I especially liked the one about what to do when your car has mechanical problems and how to fix them. And what to do in emergency situations. This course is actually a little over 5 hours long. Not 4. And you have to take mini assessment tests after each chapter which are 7 chapters/sections to this course. And they are about 10 questions. After 7 you take the big one which is about 40 or 50 questions long. You can take up to 2 years to finish the course at your own pace. Although I wouldn't really reccommend it unless you're in high school. I'm trying to get my DL asap so I'm trying to finish mine in 2 weeks. Maybe that's why I'm stressed trying to take this course lol.

Very easily accessible, and easy to navigate.

I would honestly recommend this course to anyone over 18 due to the fact that it really does work with your schedule. You can finish it in a day or two days or two months if you want to. I wasn't stressed about time limits when it came to the quizzes and this course helped me easily retain information I would have probably glossed over had I been studying the handbook myself. VERY WORTH IT!! I am not disappointed in the slightest in the teaching methods either. There was a variety so that it was not just all one way to learn. Take this course!

Kathleen,0.4,"4 hour not very helpful

This course was not the best choice. The material is outdated, from 2016 and earlier. And miscellaneously dense. Lots of numbered micro-facts which are hidden in the text rather than laid out in the numbered bullet points. These little sneak factoids are generally included on unit tests, so if you answer incorrectly, once their answer is given the natural inclination would be to focus on those particular points so you don't mess up the final exam. But you will not see them on the final. The information is just too vague so not very important. You are constantly cautioned you must score 80% to pass. The final only has 40 questions, so you can at most miss 8 questions or achieve 32 correct answers. Trivia isn't helpful to make you a better driver. Don't pay more for voice information you can read along with the robot. The tone is dull and monotonous, without inflection and I thought it was too fast to follow well. Finally, there are hidden fees. I had to pay an additional $20 to have the passing notice sent to the county clerks office. The sign-up offer doesn't include that little bit of info, and if you have put the test off to the last minute, you will not be able to be sure the results arrive in time UNLESS you pay the $20 fee. I finished on a weekend and had to wait until the following Tuesday to be sure they'd received it. There are lots of different companies offering online services for these tests. Do yourself and favor and read reviews before you choose a provider. I wish I had. The useless material saturation and added hours made a 4 hour requirement into a two-week process.",US,11,2020-04-28T18:49:03Z,iDriveSafely

Upset there must have been some fine print that signed my Mom's credit card up for a $5 a month roadside assistance program. I have no recollection for signing up for this but my Mom's credit card, used for the course, is getting hit each month for a charge. i didn't need this as my parent's already have this on Texas's AAA as well as on our State Farm car insurance. Now I have been trying for almost an hour to cancel it. On the website the link to ""Cancel"" goes to a web page that says ""web page not found"". I did a chat with someone, probably offshore, that gave me a phone number that I had already been on hold for 30 minutes. I called again and it says press 2 to call back but that doesn't work. it says it will be 2 more minutes hold time -- it has said that 10 times now. This is a scam. Pick another course.

Al,1.0,"This is the way to take course if you have to.

If you have to take a course, this is the way to do it. On your own time, at your own pace. I took the ""Voluntary - Get 5 Safe Driving Points"". I don't know if the other courses are different or not. I went ahead and also purchased the audio part, it reads it out loud to you. It was great for the long boring but necessary parts.
The quiz questions are rather specific for so much information. Surprisingly, the quizzes are more difficult than the final test itself, or maybe it just seemed that way because the course/quizzes prepared you for it so well.
Nonetheless, overall, it does make you aware of any bad driving habits you may have developed over the years. I think I am more cognizant of the proper way to drive. I am also definitely more mindful of my responsibility to be a defensive driver, because this course makes me very aware of how poorly many of the other drivers are on the road.
It's been a week and a half since I completed the course, and I am still thinking of the right and wrong things to do while on the road. Which I think is why the course is often required and or recommended by the courts. If everyone was a more mindful, law abiding, respectful driver, driving wouldn't often be so unpleasant.
If I ever have to take this course again, fingers crossed, I would definitely take this one.",US,1,2020-03-09T14:44:07Z,iDriveSafely

I can honestly say that I did learn many tips that would make me a good driver, and never thought about them, like creating a safe space, the lead eye, and always be prepared to react.

I’ve been trying to call idrivesafely for days and haven’t gotten through.

The videos and animations are high quality.

If you ever find yourself in need to take the defensive driving course, either for court, or to just educate yourself, this is the perfect way to do it! Idrive safely offered me the best price online. I truly appreciated how audio was available, if you wanted, which would read and guide you through the lessons. This way helped me to better pay attention, and not lose interest during the course. Other sites had wanted extra money for pretty much the same features! Best of all was not having to wait on your certificate in the mail. I’d seen other sites, while looking around, where this wasn’t even an option. Not only was I able to print my official copy for the court, instantly following completion, I was given an official copy for my insurance company too. If you don’t have a printer, or access to one, they offered other options to get your certificate as quickly as you need.

Do not choose this company, you only get to talk to foreign call centers that can do absolutely nothing for you.

I work for DPS and called others within DPS and this is not the case. Some of the more reputable companies send instant email certificates as soon as you pass the final. iDriveSafely completely understands and apologizes for the inconvenience but refuses hit ""send"" to send a paying customer a copy of the certificate so a kid can get his license on his 16th birthday. This is the same certificate they claim to already have in the mail. They also refuse to let you talk to a real employee that could actually do something for you. Bottom line - they could've helped me they just refused to.",US,1,2020-01-16T00:16:50Z,iDriveSafely

That entire course was absolutely horrible. Dry and boring, outdated and corny does not begin to describe this ridiculous video. The blonde girl talking about her texting habits was offensive. She sounded utterly stupid. The drunk-driving video was sooo confusing. If the twins died, who was in the video? I was so confused. The grammatical errors and the test questions are worded incorrectly and misleading and a couple of them are just plain wrong. Without the occasional reference to text messaging, I would think this video was made sometime in 1970.

I found the content of the course to be quite informative, but what was very perplexing was on very brief intro pages the timer was very often two minutes or longer, it took less than 30 seconds to read it all, which didn’t help stave off boredom while waiting to start the actual section. I also found that with all the statistics quoted, a lot of the test questions were very basic.
I personally think it would be helpful to include more information on road rage, texting and talking on the phone while driving, the new testing of self driving cars, dealing with the roads being inundated with Uber and Lyft drivers and less on the mechanics of an automobile, and guidelines for our new reality of having unpredictable heavy flooding in many areas, as well as wildfire avoidance and evacuation techniques and suggestions.",US,6,2020-01-08T17:58:45Z,iDriveSafely

they had the nerve to email me back the same incorrect certificate.

Also have an issue with the test results. When I got less than 80% I had to retake the test, which was fine, but you don’t give correct answers to the questions missed. The.

Very entertaining and explanatory with characters that will make you smile and teach you the value of driving without degrading the purpose. Throughout the course breaks down the value of safe driving with eight different tests. They also review after every section to give you a chance to understand the true meaning of safety and enable you to drive with better caution reliable action and safety measures necessary to be a better driver. Overall I feel that this was the right course for me because they offer it in two ways. 1 you can read the course and take the questions after every reading or two you can watch the 8 sections s video which offer you the characters that I mentioned above. I have seen courses before and this by far was the most friendly fun and entertaining yet not degrading the meaning and value of driving safely. If it wasn't for this course I am not sure if I would have passed because of my handicap so even somebody with learning issues can handle this and feel like everyone else. Thank you I drive safely

iDriveSafely was a very well thought out online traffic school class. I actually learned information I either had forgotten or was unaware that new laws had been written since my last drivers test. The chapters were organized in sensible and logical chapters. Not all of the demonstration videos played in my browser, but that didn't prevent me from passing my test. I liked the practice self tests at the end of the chapters to see where I might need to study more. However, I wished the final test had a better warning as to what mouse click was going to start it. I stumbled onto it and realized only then that it was too late and I had to complete the test.

The online course material is fine but there is a real problem after that point. Very bad after sales and customer service so far!!! BEWARE do not waste your money with this company if you can find another option! I completed all the online material and passed, was told at that point online that my pass would be forwarded to the DMV by the following day. I went into the DMV the following day and was told there that they had NOT received my record of completion from IDriveSafely. For 4 days in a row I have contacted IDriveSafely helpline and have been told each day the same thing, we will resolve this and you will be contacted within 24 hours to confirm. Each time they have failed to do this. Each day I have had to spend hours on hold, calling back and going through the exact same process with the operator every day to no avail. This has caused me half a day off work at the DMV, then four days waiting on hold for at least an hour each time and sometimes longer (2hours today)... Every time the same response and unfulfilled promises from the operator I deal with. Im sure it is not the operators fault but rather the company system and overall customer service makeup and hierarchy that is lacking woefully. The incompetence of the company is this area is quite astounding. Beware they will take your money and offer no real customer support in the end.

At the end of every part there is a quiz, which keeps you on your toes.

KATHERINE,1.0,"I enjoyed using a laptop

I enjoyed using a laptop, iPad and Android from anywhere to complete the course. I think there should be more information about how long the course is with the timers on each page. That way your potential customers are aware that there are for example ""12 time logged hours worth of material that are being documented digitally to meet state requirements by law."" I got through it in like 3 or 4 days but also needed mailing time I was unaware of for a total of 10 days of time for everything. Court dates and status hearings were in 11 days but almost didn't make it. My suggestion is more pressure and warnings to the student to sign up as soon as possible because that certificate is required in court and the judge can choose to decide to make new decisions that will not be in your favor. Tell them to not procrastinate because of these factors can be unpredictable their actual completion time. OR have a PDF email alternative in case the student needs a picture to show the judge.
Thanks again it was a great class.

Drive Safely was a very informative and a time friendly course. Felt that I learned more by the flexible course schedule rather than sitting in a room for five to six hours watching the time slowly go by. I used the work week to finish my course (Monday-Friday) and spent about an hour or two to work on the course. This way I never had to take time off work and was able to keep close to the house in case I needed to do some chores. I feel that Drive Safely should be more advertised for others trying to get points taken off their licenses or even to get a discount with ones insurance.

MICHAEL,1.0,"Worth the money!

I purchased the iDriveSafely online course because I received a speeding ticket in Halifax, Virginia. (Word to the wise: If you are traveling through downtown Halifax, the speed limit is 25mph!) In the state of North Carolina, you must have points on your license in order to take a classroom Driver Safety course. I do not have any points on my license nor insurance. Fortunately, I was able to take an online class to meet the requirement in the state of Virginia.
I recommend this online course because you read the material at your own pace. At the end of each unit, you can print the review of material, which I did to help me answer the multiple choice questions. There are 10 multiple choice questions at the end of each unit. The final exam is 25 questions, and you must score an 80 in order to pass. I missed only 1 question and scored a 96!",US,1,2019-11-13T22:17:50Z,iDriveSafely

The overall program was well designed to meet the goals set by the State. On a few pages, the timer ran longer than the movie so that was a little distracting. The extra seconds could be spread out and added to some of the reading only pages so that the need to fill the mandated 6 hours is not in such an obvious overrun position. Most users will not have spent a career as work mechanics so they will not have noticed the very few discrepancies between verb and subject (single and plural mixed as an example). However, having substitute taught in a local high school, I do know that most of the users will not even know the difference. The writing is well enough edited so that going through to correct the few errors would probably not be economically justified.

Taking this course, I learned lots of new information that I didn’t know. It was a blessing in disguise .

The lessons are very easy to understand and they give you plenty of time to answer and clear any doubts you have on the same page you are studying by clicking a button in the bottom of the page .

This course is excellent because they give you plenty of time to finish the course at your own pace.

I loved the security feature they have by only you knowing the correct answers to the Questions you selected before hand.

The customer service agents are always pleasant and eager to help you in any way possible.

I enjoyed being able to take the class in the comfort of my home at my own pace. I learned somethings, other things refreshed my memory. It has served me well in that what I have learned and reviewed, I go over in my head and practice what I learned in the class while on the highway. I practice being a safe driver anyway, but I do not let the habits of other drivers influence me in anyway now. I will just have to be the slowest driver out there to obey the speed limits. If they cuss me out driving the speed limit in the slow lane, then so be it. I will deal with the road rage. Thank you for this service. I did benefit in many ways.

What it does not take in consideration is all the computerized changes to cars that provide for automatic braking, hands-free driving, in-lane driving etc. Todays cars provide for distance control as well if using cruise control; thereby, retaining the appropriate amount of space between cars or risk having the cruise control decrease putting control of the car back in the drivers hands. The statistical information provided in this course are: 1) interesting facts, 2) outdated and 3) not pertinent to how to drive a vehicle. I found topics such as: 1) how to deal with a tailgater, 2) medicine, alcohol and drug impact on driving (no, this was not my issue) and 3) how to tell if someone is impaired and what to do, far more important to today's drivers.
Its a shame motor vehicles can not send out a state/nationwide information pamphlet (hardcopy regular mail delivered) covering some of these topics. It could possibly decrease road rage by making people think about situations they experience.
I found a lot of good information to update my skills; just as there was outdated information driven by technology. I would recommend it to anyone needing a refresher on some driving methodologies, needing an extra 5 points added to their driver record or desiring to lower their insurance. Yes, I did pass first time taking the test :)",US,2,2019-09-21T22:21:51Z,iDriveSafely

I take this course every 3 years primarily for the Insurance discount.

The only criticism I would have after taking the course & traveling in & out of NYC for 30 years is; the course needs to spend more time on cell phone calls & texting, putting on make-up, electric shaving and reading a folded Wall Street Journal behind the wheel in traffic.

It was also presented in such a fashion that retention was made easy, and I am proud to say I got an 84% score 1st time thru.I am also so glad I did it, as it alerted me to many things that over the years has faded a little, and I needed to be reminded. It sharpened my focus with regard to the rules of the road. Well done guys. You’re doing an excellent job and I highly recommend ‘I drive safely’ to anyone who has to do it, or even in my estimation anyone who would like to do it, to be more aware of the pitfalls out there, and to shake off some bad habits that have developed over the years. Thanks again. Hope next time we meet it is when I feel like a little refresher, and not under the circumstances that forced me to you this time. :-)

Told I would get an email that same day, NEVER did. Call again the next day and 1st time calling the phone went silent after 8 minutes of waiting and the call dropped on their side. Then I called again and waited 20 minutes and when I was finally able to talk to someone then they told me they would send it that same day, NEVER GOT anything until 3 days later after calling the first time.

Thank you for getting everything fixed.


Don’t use this company, there are many others that you could use. The site is outdated and clunky. First issue was that you have to enter a reservation number that the State provides but this service kept saying it was an incorrect number. Well no kidding, the number given by the State has more numbers in it than you can enter into this site to get started.

I wish I had read the other reviews before I spent $59.89 for my grandson's prep for driving. It is a scam! I have tried the last 3 days to call them and left my phone # 2 days ago for them to call me and nothing. They don't answer the phone after holding for 20 min. the 1st day, 20 min. the 2nd day, and 32 min. yesterday. I called early in the morning sometimes. There is no where on their website to contact them either so I guess I am just going to report them to the Better Business Bureau. I was never able to get on their site to do any of what I had bought either. It just had a black screen that said our flash needs to be updated. We did that a couple of times with no results.

Shopping Account,0.2,"BEWARE--BEWARE--BEWARE: NO MOBILE CAPABILITY

If I could give this review LESS than one star, I would. One of the main reasons I signed up for Defensive Driving with this website was because it advertised (in multiple locations online) that users were able to access the course from any device, ie; mobile phones, tablets, ipads, or computers. I was using my cell phone to access the course and after the first few videos would not load, I decided to email customer support. They proceeded to respond to me and told me to close all other windows (I only had this webpage open in Safari on my phone), and then told me that currently their website does not support the use of mobile devices, tablets, or ipads. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?! So I promptly emailed them demanding a refund and even sent screenshots of their website advertising the use of mobile and tablet devices. After waiting for 2 days without a response, I emailed them AGAIN and demanded a refund. Side Note: I looked online for a number to call to request a refund but could only find an email address and a FAX number. I got a response the next day and the rep told me they couldn't process refunds via email and that I would need to call customer service. Of course I let him know that I would have GLADLY done that rather than waiting had there been a number online for me to call. Needless to say, they ended up calling ME and informing me they were processing my refund. If I don't have my money back in my account in 10 days, I'll be calling and emailing AGAIN.

I took the course just to avoid having points added to my record and being someone who prefers videos over just listening to an audio I paid the extra money for the videos and am glad I did! The videos gave great visual examples of the results of poor driving skills as well as how to correct them, whereas if one were to just listen to an audio it's very easy for your attention to wander and you learn little to nothing. As a matter of fact, I would recommend that the video course be made mandatory for all new drivers before they are granted a license! the information is that good! Not only did I learn things that cleared up a few of my bad driving habits but I also shared the information with my wife who identified a few bad habits as well.

I took this course instead on recommendations from reviews saying it was legit, and was happy that the final completion certificate I submitted to the courts fully satisfied their traffic school request and removed the charge from me! Legit all the way! It took a lot of hours (probably would have been shorter to go to traffic school), but it was simple, straightforward and saved me from a physical class. FYI--to get the certificate emailed you have to pay extra, so don't want until last minute to complete the course, like me.

As much as I honestly didn’t really want to do this program I’ve got to admit it was totally worth my time! Yes, it took a few hours to complete and to pass the test but I’ll tell you this much for sure I always watch my speed now-a-days and that’s something I really wasn’t good at doing prior to that faithful speeding ticket that led me to Secretary of State “I Drive Safely” Program. The reason I did the program was because I was informed that my ticket would not be reported to my Insurance Company which in turn would mean no higher insurance rate and no points on my driver’s record either! Not to mention I did learn a thing or two throughout and up to the completion of this program. It was great that I was able to keep my driving record clean and learn not to speed ever again. By the way, I printed up each section as I went along so that my teenage guardian daughter can use this valuable study guide when she is old enough to get her drivers license.

Also along with it being extremely boring, it was really really really long and took me forever to complete. I hated that stupid timer it had on every page, I read much faster than it.

H. Mara,1.0,"Great for last-minute test takers. Clear, organized material and review tests and notes made for informative, painless, and successful completion. I highly recommend!

I opted to learn the material in written form. It’s the equivalent of a full-day class. I waited until the last-minute, so did it all at once. (California requires proof of completion to be sent to the courts electronically. I finished the morning of my last possible day. They recorded as such and submitted the next day. No issues on their part at all!) It would have been easy to divide it up into smaller sections to do over time. The material was presented in a clear, organized way. I liked that they had review notes and review tests after each chapter, plus an overall review section at the end, which you can print. As crazy as it sounds, since I didn’t go into the class to necessarily learn, I feel like I’m a better, more aware driver after taking this class. (I only took it to get out of a speeding ticket. I guess becoming a better, safer driver is the point of the course. Lol) I am going to have my teen driver do the equivalent class before he gets on the road...very informative and an eye-opener to have the statistics for different accidents/dangers presented as they were.

Took it for a Virginia driver improvement as required by the court (Note that you have to upload your court letter before beginning the course). There are various options depending on your needs. Format is text (included) or audio (additional $5). It goes page by page (like a textbook) and each page is timed ~30 sec., so you can't advance ahead because, by law, it's supposed to take 8 hrs like the offline course. You take the final exam offsite as required by law.

I think that this course did a great job in refreshing the lesser known rules of the road in my head.

I actually didn’t read a lick of the material and skipped straight through to the quizzes and still felt that I learned a great deal.

My criticism is about the road trip part. I noticed the course mentioning tips for how to stay invested in your kids and make sure they are having a good time on trips and knowing what is truly important.

The program is very organized and detailed with 8 modules in the program. Even if you have been driving for more than 35 years (as I have), you will learn something new, perhaps confirm some things that you already do that you had learned/developed based on your experience. I do feel that the program could be condensed by 30% by focusing on principles of driving rather than individual categories (if that makes sense). Another recommendation would be to make the course more interactive, less passive, to better keep the attention of the audience.

My experience with ""I Drive Safely"" began after an accidental accident, whereas I was the driver. I was issued a citation, which I paid immediately. I was hurt during this accident and have some PTSD as a result. I took my safety class as directed and I won't be driving any more forever, per my own volition. The Driver Safety Class was fabulous. I really studied before I took the final exam. I was certified with an 80+ grade. The whole experience was fabulous, very worth the fee I had to pay. Its too bad this test can't be given to EVERYone with a license - BEFORE getting their license and followed up periodic classes throughout their lifetime. I was not proud that I rear-ended this person (I passed out for the split second it took to hit her). I will always be sorry to her for this event. I hope she is still ok. Please, take this class if you are ordered to do so, or better yet, take it if its available to anyone, whether its ordered to do so or not.

Zhen(Jay) Chen,0.6,"Really painful experience!!!!!

I finish my drive safely course on 04/10 and receive my certificate, but till now (about 2-month after), when I check on the TDLR website, I can't find any validation evidence of that certificate as IDirveSafely promised. Also, there is no certificate number showing on my certificate (I have faxed the notarized student affidavit form just after I finished the course). What a shameful experience and customer service is really painful. I plan to choose another company to retake this course.

BTW, I made a phone call no one responds (always saying that the customer service department is temporarily closed.), even during the working time 6 am - 8 pm. After 2-hour attempt, I got the response and they told me that they haven't received my notarized student affidavit form. What a terrible customer service. Really unpleasant. I hope they can make a change.

OK. here is the afterward progress:
I resent my notarized affidavit form and received an email which is the confirmation of the completion of my course and said that my certificate will be reissued on the same day (Monday morning). I waited till the afternoon, there still was no update of my invalid certificate. I made a phone call, the consultant said that it would take 24 hours to process and I will get my certificate on Tuesday. Fine. I trusted them and waited until Tuesday noon around 12 pm. I didn't see any update. Since it had already been 24 hours since I received the first email. I called them again. The consultant said that it might take 24-48 hours and she could email her senior for check and put a request for my case and I could get my certificate this afternoon. I trusted her again. But, but, at 5 pm, I still failed to reach the reissued certificate. I made a phone call again. The consultant said that my case went to the technical department and there may be some technical issue about this. It would take more times. But I could get my certificate on Wednesday if no more information was needed. And she would let me know and call me back if there is any update or any reply from the processing department! This is the last time I trusted this. I do hope I can get my certificate tomorrow (Wednesday). I have nothing to say with customer service. All consultants are friendly. But this company is really inefficient. I am not sure whether I can get my valid certificate before the due date to dismiss my ticket. You can hardly image issuing a valid certificate will take so much time. Finally I got reissued certificate on Wednesday and will check its validation in 5 days on TDLR website.",US,1,2019-06-12T15:59:39Z,iDriveSafely
Marsha Gilbert,0.2,"Completely frustrated

I purchase this course for my son who is learning to drive. I wish we had just gone to a class in person. We kept having problems with the course loading---the first two times wasn't bad--within 48 hours they had it working right again. The third time, we were told that it was because of the browser we were using--we had to use chrome; we needed to install a ""flash"" the lady on the phone said--and then said that this was all she could do for us. When I told her I did not even know what ""flash"" she was talking about, she walked us through the installation. When the course still wouldn't work, she hung up on us. I tried calling back and the woman on the other end pretending that there was a problem with the connection and she couldn't hear me (I called other people to make sure my phone was working, I restarted my phone) I called back again and she again pretended she couldn't hear me. My son called back on another phone and was told that we needed a ""partial completion"" certificate in order to proceed. WHAT KIND OF A COMPANY IS THIS!

I figured I had wasted my time & money to get a certificate one day late, & I would still pay all the fines. I figured iDriveSafely was one of those companies that was big on sales, and less than poor on service.
I could not have been more wrong. I got an email address off of one of these reviews & emailed today, but I sure did not expect a reply. I got a prompt reply. The company has a help desk open today.

Linden,0.2,"I wish I could give this course a ""0""

I wish I could give this course a ""0"". What a nightmare! I am posting in my FB page and senior groups NEVER TO USE THIS COMPANY. Also writing letters to the FL DMV, AG, and Consumer Protection agencies.

Complaints:
1) The material is full of grammatical errors
2) The ""review"" pages do not contain the questions on the mini-quiz for that chapter
3) The corrections page after the quiz does NOT tell you the correct answers to any questions missed, and the info on that page does not relate in any way to the material from that chapter. So the student cannot learn from his/her mistakes
4) The Review Page attached to the course is from 2010, NINE YEARS OLD! No wonder they kept quoting figures from 2005! The review document is 9 years out of date!
5) The Review document is not tailored to the course material, it is generic. A teen driver course should have material geared to that course, mature drivers should have a review for that course.
6) There is NO PHONE, CHAT, OR EMAIL CONTACT on the main page, or even a ""Contact Us"" page. I had to find it on the GetHuman website.
7) There are NO TERMS AND CONDITIONS anywhere on the website. They are only presented on the ""Payment"" page at the end of the course. This is ILLEGAL.
8) The website clearly states that this course is accessible by ANY DEVICE, and yet, when their software fails repeatedly (as in the mini-exam issue), the tech support claims that it is the customer's fault if using a tablet. What?! No accountability at all.
9) On the payment page at the end, the price for 2-day delivery was $17, but on the next page with CC info, the charge was $19, so I had to call AGAIN to try to straighten this out, and was told that there was no ""back"" button to get to the previous page, and neither could the cust service reps. UNACCEPTABLE! THEN, they told me that 2-day FedEx is only for 2 BUSINESS DAYS, NOT 2 calendar days.

In short, this course needs to be decertified until the company can start to act like a real company instead of some outfit run out of someone's pickup truck. Disgraceful, by any professional standard. I consider it fraudulent business practice. FRAUD.",US,1,2019-05-02T01:10:38Z,iDriveSafely

Paige Smith,0.2,"Save yourselves. Save your money. Pick a different course.

I'm 17 and this is the first driving course I've ever taken. I have to tell you- it's such a disappointment. Probably the only good thing is that I haven't had to contact customer service yet- I've heard from other reviews that it's terrible.

The course takes absolutely forever to finish, even though it's advertised as one of the shortest. Every single page has an allotted amount of time you have to spend there, and it was usually between 3-7 minutes more than I needed. If you're a fast reader, bring something else to do. I have been working on this course on and off for over a year and still do not have my licence.

The testing situation on their website is also very messed up. The website asks parents at the end of every module to ""review the questions your teen missed on the quiz"" even though there wasn't a quiz anywhere in the material. The few review tests that there are are not very thorough, all the same format, and very easy to pass.

In addition, the material in iDriveSafely's course is horrible quality and horribly organized. The lessons are very repetitive and not at all interactive. Their videos are outdated and extremely negative. Driving is depicted is so dangerous that I almost forgot why am wanted to learn in the first place. Often, when I'm behind the wheel of my car, I get anxiety attacks and flashbacks from the gory images shown in the videos.

Overall, if you want to be frustrated, stressed out, and the last one of your friends to get a driver's licence, iDrive Safely is the course for you! Wish me luck finishing this nightmare.",US,1,2019-04-05T18:36:27Z,iDriveSafely

I signed up for the course on Friday, they took my money immediately, but they still won't accept the citation.

First I took a picture of it, waited a couple of days, only for them to tell me it wasn't good enough. So I traced over the parts that were faded, went and got it scanned, and tried to upload it. It didn't give me any message, just sent me back to the same page, so I assumed it had gone through. Wait a day, check again, nothing. So I try again, I convert it to two other formats, try to submit each one, nothing. I wait until the morning, call them, and I get an email address, to which I send the scan. When they finally get back to me, it's to say it's not good enough. So I type out all of the information they request and email it back. Still not good enough, and now they send me back the original picture, not the scan that I sent later. So I called again, guy at customer support said he'd have to take it up with a supervisor and call me back in half an hour. I never got a call back.

Given the number of negative reviews with similar complaints, I'm not sure that there's any real point to emailing them at their ""wecare"" email address. I believe they care about their ratings when they get negative reviews, but I don't believe they really care about their customers. They are spending their money on Google Ads to get the number one spot when someone searches for ""traffic school"" or similar terms, but not on updating/correcting their content and definitely not on staffing real customer service agents who are available at the published phone number.

Brandy,0.6,"Texas Drivers Education

The course itself is easy. The live action videos are cheesy and a little outdated but overall it makes it easy to pass the quizzes and the final exam. After completing the course, however, I started running into issues. First, I paid for the course and selected the FREE standard USPS mailing, and was told if I completed my course before 3 PM, they would ship it the same business day. Awesome, right? Makes it way easier for me. I completed the course around 5 AM on a Friday, and only received a downloadable certificate. The screen before downloading told me that I needed to print the certificate and fill out a DE-964 form (Drivers Education Certificate Order Form)…. Why would I need to print the certificate and fill out this form so I pay can for a hard copy if they are supposed to send me a hard copy of my certificate through the mail? I never received the confirmation email for the shipping of my certificate, even though it was a business day and before 3 PM. Second issue I ran into was receiving an E-mail stating that ""Its Time to Drive"" prompting me to go to their partner site, DriversEd.com, and buy 150$ driving lessons because I only completed the online portion of DE? They told me that I am required to have 7 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 7 hours of driving observation.... While the DPS website states that the Traditional Drivers Ed requires both classroom and behind-the-wheel training, that is not what I signed up for. I signed up for 100% ONLINE Texas Adult Drivers Education, which does NOT require behind-the-wheel training. No where on I Drive Safely's website does it state that this is a ""partial certificate program"" either.... I see this as a trick to try and get more money out of people, making them believe that this is a requirement when it really isn't. All in all, I don't think I would recommend them, what's done is done for me as far as the Drivers Education course goes but they are a little unorganized and misleading. I was considering taking the Insurance course to lower my car insurance, but after receiving my license I think I will opt for an in-classroom Defensive Driving course, which will cost a little more but I am sure will be a better and more organized and up front experience.

Armando C,0.8,"I just completed my course for…

I just completed my course for dismissing my ticket. Overall okay experience, you know how these go. Have to sit here for hours to just bull crap your way through it. Nonetheless, the only problem I had prior to actually even starting my course was the fact that it made me pay for an eCertificate that I didn't really want. It was $15 extra on top of the $25 I'm normally supposed to pay for. Crazy thing is, is that there was no option for me to not buy it or in other words take it off of my checkout/total. Kinda seemed like it was a package deal but there wasn't an option to just buy the regular $25 package I wanted to pay for. looked all through out the page to try and see if it was possible to not get the eCertificate but it was kinda like it was forcing me to but it. So my dumb self went a long with it only because I need to turn this certificate course in soon. Fast forward, I finish the course, go through the process of finalizing and theres screen that comes up and says ""would you like to speed up your shipping process"" or something like that. offers you 2 day shipping etc. for more money. The only other option there was for me-becuase I didn't want to pay more, was to click on the option that said something like ""I will stick to my eCertificate (already purchased)"" which I thought was stupid because it wasn't even what I wanted in the first place. It also didn't tell me if I chose this option that I will still get my certificate in the mail. Like I want to know if I'm getting it in the mail or not don't make me assume.

Its trash. Why, becuase i spent $45 dollars on a package that said ""Florida TLSAE Course+Online Permit Test.""

I went to the DMV took about 3 hours for me to go up to the counter for them to tell me that the test I took WAS NOT the Permit test. I could have sworn I took the test so I call IDriveSafely and they tell me, ""oh that wasn't the permit test, that was all practice blah blah blah."" I was left in disbelief.

I have paid my money to the “Drug & Alcohol and also for the Permit Exam” package. I purchased it before my 18th birthday, and since it took me many hours, I did not finish it on the same day. It took my a bit of time to finally have the time and finish the exams, especially my Permit exam. It said, “CONGRATULATIONS, you have passed with an 85%, now we will send your certificate to the DMV and receive your completion of your permit.”
It’s been a month later, that I realized I had no record or receipt or proof that I had finished this permit exam. So I called and asked about my info.
They said no I did NOT complete it because the next day, I turned 18.
The PROBLEM is that they did NOT send me a notification of no such that the exam has been DECLINED this WHOLE time.
They did NOT give me a refund because the “30 days” has passed already, BUT HOW WAS I SUPPOSE TO KNOW THAT I NEEDED TO CALL THEM FOR A REFUND IF THEY NEVER TOLD ME, MY PERMIT EXAM HAS BEEN DELCINED!
They tricked me....it’s not fair for me to waste my days on this and especially my money on it.

jo,0.4,"outdated, not really helpful

so I HAD to write a review, will this get u a certificate yeah, but do they give a hoot about their customers, not really. there website has a spot where u can email them for information, but they haven't updated their captcha so its useless. theres a spot which lets you test out the validation procedure and asks u to call to make sure it works but you call and it asks for a pin THAT YOU DONT HAVE and cant get until it generates one for you during the course thus there is no way to actually test anything out and it took me half an hour to get to talk to someone on the phone after pressing so many button options half of which dont even make sense. lastly there is errors in their course, which is why i wanted to call their tech support but waited half an hour on the phone non of the options made sense and waited half an hour to get in contact with someone but couldnt (hence why i wanted to email which I CANT) ... there course has one spot where it states

""The location of 30 seconds on the road ahead will vary depending on your speed :

Traveling at 25 mph, 30 seconds ahead is about two and one half blocks.

At 30 mph, 30 seconds ahead is close to two blocks.""

This logically doesn't make sense. You cannot drive faster within the same time span and get a lesser distance.

so all in all if u can settle with just getting a certificate and reading statistics from 2011 and hardly getting any customer support this is the place for you, but you are really just filling their pockets because they will never update the site and hardly answer their phones.",US,1,2019-01-07T18:26:39Z,iDriveSafely

I was expecting a 'read the paragraph and answer the question' format where I would have to sit at the computer and wait for the required time to pass. This was so much better. Good information, some cute diversions and breaks between sections.

My caveats that keep this rating from being 5 star are that the visuals seemed fuzzy, as if they were filmed from a power point presentation or adapted from a video or really old. That took away from some of the effectiveness. Also the latest statistical info was 2010, which is a long time ago. I can't believe there aren't more recent statistics.

All in all a good online program, which meant I didn't have to go to a live presentation. I learned a lot, even though I have been driving with few accidents for 55 years.",US,3,2018-12-12T20:56:00Z,iDriveSafely

The I DRIVE SAFELY course is a well structured refresher course which gives the participant an opportunity to review the basic principles of safe driving in a comprehensive manner. I definitely became more aware of the areas of my own driving skills which could be improved, particularly when the material focused on the statistics of roadway accidents. Whether the course actually influences anyone to change their driving practices would require research ( which may have been done already) but taking this course certainly has made me more ""aware"" while on the road, which is a good outcome.The cost of the program is very reasonable and couldn't be more convenient than sitting at your computer for a learning experience.
