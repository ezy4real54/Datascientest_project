Paul,1.0,"Watch out for the gotchas.

Two or three or sometimes four academic questions are asked at the end of each section. But watch out, one section asks the color of the drivers shirt. I wasn't watching because I was listening while I was doing chores. So, I got that question wrong and had to listen to it all again. Then I was asked what kind of car was used in the lesson. I thought it was an SUV, but that wasn't one of the answers. I feel sorry for a woman that doesn't know the difference between a smart car and a VW Beetle because those were two of the choices. My wife doesn't know what a smart car is. She thinks that it is a car that drives itself. Gotcha",US,1,2022-08-06T01:49:15Z,"Comedy Driving, Inc."

This was less painful than sitting in a classroom for six hours. You can start and stop the course at your convenience.

The jokes weren’t that funny, but they could have been worse. The only complaint I have is I didn’t receive an e-mail confirmation or receipt after I registered. I had to call Customer Service to get it. When I finished the course, I was able to print my certificate right away.

It was somewhat annoying that the video would not be in sync with pages. you'd finish a page, click next and a dialog box would say you hadn't spent enough time on the page, even though you had.
The system would ask rather silly questions about the color of a particular vehicle involved in an incident, or how many law authorities were in a particular video. I mean I know they want to see if you've been watching, but something more relevant then car colors or number of law authorities is annoying.",US,2,2022-06-11T00:24:04Z,"Comedy Driving, Inc."

Charlie,1.0,"Trustworthy Online Course

As I researched the various Online TX Driving Safety Courses, I discovered that most of them will not allow you to see how much they charge for their available options as to how you can receive the certificate of completion. There are different fees for electronic certificates, standard mail, one-day & 2-day mail; you have to give your credit card number for the course before you can see how much more they are going to charge for how you receive the certificate of completion. I spent about 3 hours researching this and then I called Comedy Driving in Houston, TX directly at approximately 9pm to verify the prices on their website and my call was returned immediately. They only charge $2 for standard mail and $5 for the immediate electronic download. After I completed the course I received my certificate as a pdf to file and print within a few minutes.

I really enjoyed using the course provided by comedydriving.com.
Being not computer literate, I chose to use the public library as I do not have a computer at home.
Since the course is about 6 hours in length; I advise anyone to start earlier than I did. My course has to be in the Justice of the Peace Office on Monday. Here it is Thursday. I may gave to hand deliver
(drive 5 hours) this weekend to make sure I get this to the Judge on time. My advise is if you get a traffic ticket...DO NOT PROCRASTINATE! I was given 4 months to get this done but I got sick and could not work on it untill 2 days ago. I enjoyed Comedy bc it is very well done and holds your interest. It is very thirough.

I enjoyed your class very much. It kept me awake and laughing throughout the entire thing. I loved the animals in the videos. Funny.

What I didn't like was that you asked questions that I thought were irrelevant, such as the mile marker number on a sign in one segment and then asking how many police officers were directing traffic in another segment, or were on motorcycles.

Well, I was taking my own notes for testing purposes on the material itself. I didn't focus on a mile marker sign number or the number of officers in a video. I had to retake some sections due to those silly questions, which were irrelevlant to the material I was learning.

So, then I had to start focusing on things that had nothing to do with the learning material, which I thought was wasteful time for me. I get it, you need to make sure the person is actually paying attention, which I was, but I was only paying attention to the material, not other things in the video.

I loved the class otherwise. I would take it again if I had to take a defensive driving course again.",US,1,2022-04-15T15:53:40Z,"Comedy Driving, Inc."

It took longer for me to complete which is the bad part about it. Some questions were tricky, not easy, and I missed, and I had to re-watch that whole section.

Other than that, just typical reminders about certain traffic rules, which I were not aware, or which were useful.

Thomas P.,0.8,"At Least It Isn't Mundane

For being a defensive driving course, it wasn't the worst one I've ever taken. The only things that I didn't like about it and therefore keep me from giving 5 stars is 1)the course said you could finish in 5 hours and that's just a blatant lie, it was still 6 hours like every other DD course in Texas. 2)There were numerous glitches that were irritating, like the timer for each chapter not updating right away once I went to the next chapter, and how sometimes the video for a page would be, say 1 minute long, but the timer made me stay on that page for 2 minutes.. What is the point of that, other than to annoy the person taking the class (ie me)? There were also a handful of grammatical errors, but that's not part of the rating, I'm just pointing it out so someone can go through and fix them because that's not a great look.

This was a fair way of presenting the defensive driving course material. The identity checks were good, the questions to make sure you were watching the videos was good with the exception of one. The only real complaint was the low budget of the animation. Considering what is available on the market place now what you have is very sub standard.
The only question I had problems with and felt was unfair was for the video where you introduced 4 or 5 characters who had been drinking at a party. The question dealt with recalling one character specifically. I remembered the characters and the message they were telling but to remember a one specific name was unfair question.",US,1,2022-01-05T22:55:45Z,"Comedy Driving, Inc."

Easily the most painless defensive driving I've done! You won't split your sides laughing or anything, but there's enough there to get a grin, and that's better than most. It's also very inexpensive. A lot of it is animated, and that makes it seem a little more fun and not so dry and boring. If you have a short attention span like me, I recommend doing it over 3-4 days so you don't burn yourself out. More if you need it, less if you don't. For $5 (making the total price $30), you can get your certificate emailed to you immediately after you finish. All in all, it was easy and it went by fast.

Gabriel,0.8,"Better than a straight-up ""sit…

Better than a straight-up ""sit down/live"" course, but not as funny as the title may lead people to believe. Only part I found really sort of funny was where the guy ran over the animals (although the points about NOT swerving were ones I never considered). Reginald was just plain obnoxious--I'd drop him or redo him. Jimmy Bobby was also a bit overdone, even for the typical East-Texas Redneck he largely portrays. I'd say Carl was the one that seemed most comical with how he got mad over such silly things.

My in-app review already stated this, but it would be best to put questions closer to the end or following up right after the vids end, and not putting up 2-3 new information segments, then asking the questions, which may not be answered correctly because now we're 5-6 minutes past the original content; I would frankly use an app like Edpuzzle or edit the vids so the questions pop up during the vid and the vid pauses: I would do this at 3-5 minute intervals max; don't have a vid lasting 15 minutes and then wait to spring questions on users right after--that's way too long.",US,2,2021-12-20T21:53:01Z,"Comedy Driving, Inc."

This course was very beneficial in teaching me some new things about safe driving and reminding me of some things that had slipped into my distant memory over time. The segments about the dangers of using i-phones and/or other devices while driving should be required viewing for all teens getting their initial driver's license. The segments about driving and drinking would likely benefit anyone who drinks and drives - the dangers and costs are just not worth it! In my opinion this course has probably saved many lives.

I don't control Chrome or Internet speed and didn't run into much. As a #1 grad in computer science and Cyber, fairly good A to A- least. I wouldn't recommend it on a phone or tablet because my eyes are bad and I need good speakers to hear it well.

The course was good and I passed but the questions should be based around what's important in the video, not every little detail you show in a video. For example I got a question wrong because I didn't know what type of vehicle a police officer was seen driving in the beginning of the video for less than 5 seconds. Maybe I sneezed at that moment or took a drink of my water at that moment. It doesn't mean I wasn't paying attention. I wrote down very good notes in every video but still had to watch the video over because my eyes didn't catch something that was totally irrelevant in a matter of two seconds. Again, the questions should be based on facts of driving do's and don'ts not what flower was blooming on the side of the road.",US,1,2021-12-07T20:28:06Z,"Comedy Driving, Inc."

Fairly good course, except very annoying that, even though I waited the correct amount of time after each screen session to click on ""Next"" button, half the time, I still got the warning box saying that I needed to spend xx amount of time on this screen (even though I had spent more time than required). So I just got used to clicking back on the play button to play the last 20-30 seconds of that screen before it would let me go to the next one. THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED!!! Very annoying and time consuming. Plus no one is interested in seeing all the credits you are ""forced"" to see before going to the next screen. Stupid credits have zero to do with defensive driving. Ever been to an indoor movie? Everyone starts walking out as soon as the credits start showing and by the time they're done showing credits the theater is empty, except for the couple who's making out in the 5th row.",US,1,2021-10-05T00:47:38Z,"Comedy Driving, Inc."

On this one, you have to pass the test questions that show up AT THE MIDDLE TO END OF each chapter...there IS no big, or final test at the end. It is an as you go test...
This should be mentioned somewhere. You have to pass by 70% which isn't too hard to do because a lot of questions are common sense.

Ira S Smith,1.0,"Distinctly Different

I have taken a few of these driver education courses and I must admit that I found this course refreshingly interesting and fun. Plus it attacked the driving points totally differently and I actually learned a few things I was not actually aware of because of their examples. It was definitely not the cut and dried textual version. What was nice there were texts at the bottom if you wanted it and to study it a little closer. There are a couple of things which seemed to violate what you said which I pointed out in my comments at end, namely you say don't text and drive yet when she sees the weaving pickup she gets on her phone to call the police. Might want to clean that up a little. Why didn't she pull over to the shoulder then and call? Shame shame! Anyway, excellent course and was actually enjoyable to see a different way.

Defensive driving is a hassle and there's no getting around that, But Comedy's course is a very convenient, simple, and inexpensive way to get it over with. I had to email them a notarized affidavit because I had an out-of-state license and figured they would get back to me in a day or two, but they processed it and sent me my certificate in about three minutes. I will use them again if I ever need to.",US,1,2021-08-05T00:01:47Z,"Comedy Driving, Inc."

Douglas,0.8,"To make this course so that is is state…

To make this course so that is is state approved and funny is a serious challenge. Overall, you did a good job. Some of the videos need to be redrawn and you need to add more humor. Sorry, though, as I have no idea how to do that.

Also, warn your customers to be cautious when they apply for an insurance discount...too much info such as taking the course to avoid a speeding ticket will not allow a discount. In an effort to answer my insurance company's questions about the course accurately and honesty, I did not receive the discount.

D Pollack,1.0,"Become A Better Driver - Save money on your car Insurance

This Driving Defensive course was a totally eye opening experience. You learn more about being a better driver on the road. They use actual driving in Houston videos to show how accidents happen, the proper procedures of turning right on red, how to drive during an outage of the traffic light. Watching out for drivers not paying attention. A moving and emotional tribute to people who lost their lives from texting and driving. Actual people who now have to live with the death of someone they love killed by their text messaging them. Learn so much information you may have not remembered from when you took drivers education when you were learning to drive. Also save money on your car insurance by taking the course. Its a great refresher on how to be a better driver on the road. Also if you have a moving violation on your driving record, taking the course can get it removed. It is a excellent program.

Quirkiest but most effective technique I have ever seen. As an educator with much experience with curriculum, I was impressed with how the course is structured and monitored. There is potential for cheating but I don't know who would want to go through this pain for someone else. And besides, the person cheating would literally have to be seated right next to his/her proxy. Not even worth it.
I would add one major item missing- any changes in Texas law, to include year. There were a few times through the course when I though, when did that happen, and I've been driving over 40 years! Example, school bus stopping by certain medians, driving on the right shoulder to pass, etc. It would also lend more legitimacy to the course knowing that the most recent motor vehicle laws have been implemented.

I would have to rate this the best online driving course ever. It was information but not stressful. Even after driving for 55 years I learned news things and current stats that I was not aware of.

The only drawback for me was that I live in the country and have pretty pitiful internet service so the live videos were consistently trying to download. Ugh!

Duane,1.0,"Comedy Defensive Driving is the Best Option.

This program, although not comedy club caliber, does exactly what is claims to do: it fulfills the necessary state requirements of defensive driving, while at the same time keeping you entertained to a point where you remained focused on the presented material while time passes faster than you realize.

The animated characters that narrate the class are memorable, and some of the celebrity sound-alikes are fairly decent (Office Bakon (not Bacon) with a Patrick Warburton demeanor, Judge Dredd that sounds a lot like Christopher Walken, etc.)

To sum it up, this presentation is a complete thumbs up! If you choose Comedy Defensive Driving®, you wont be disappointed and you might learn a few things that will save time, aggravation, and lives on the highway.",US,1,2021-06-04T18:58:46Z,"Comedy Driving, Inc."

I very much enjoyed the course. The reason I gave 4 Stars instead of 5.....the last video about DWI was quite old and to long. There could be a little more about night time driving i.e. at what distance/when to turn from high beam to low beam with oncoming traffic. Additionally, should one use a quick flash of the head light to signal oncoming traffic if they totally fail to lower their lights? I received a citation for that reason. Other than that it was educating and entertaining.

Of the two online DDC courses I have taken,one in 2018, Comedy Driving is the most informative and engaging course, I have ADHD. The engagement is probably why I was able to participate longer than two hours at a time. I went from Chapter 1 to Chapter 8 on Saturday May 28 @ 7:00pm and signed off around 12:45 May 29, 2021. What was even nicer about it is that the majority of the videos contained images of my Hometown of Houston, TX that included two of my neighborhoods, one in downtown Houston. I could identify with what they were talking about much better. It is no holds barred but funny and silly at the same time.",US,2,2021-05-30T20:07:58Z,"Comedy Driving, Inc."

If you have the option of a boring agenda or adding a little humor into your life, you tell me which you would select! I highly recommend this online course. I am a repeat customer, unfortunately due to my life choice to put myself in a position to get speeding tickets, but if I can't change this requirement to take a driver safety training course, I feel the next choice I made was a wise one!

We should always remember that it's not just us out driving but that our neighbors and other people have to be on the road too during the day to go work and go about their business and daily lives. Everyone has a different kind of vehicle and a different goal for the day and we should all respect that. All the videos in this course are very helpful and encouraging.

Norma,0.8,"The basic content is really good

The basic content is really good. Someone needs to proof the presentation for simple errors, The speaker on one or two of the segments went a little fast for me. As I listen I tend to think about what was said, much as a good reader stops and thinks about what was read. This increases the absorption of content. It is not about speed reading.
The timing! There were many places in the second half particularly, where the presentation stops, but the time allotted was not used so I had to wait before going to the next segment. That was a bit frustrating, especially at the end of a several hour session.
I have found myself thinking and rethinking my driving habits as a result of really good information and presentation.

This was an easy way to take Def. Driving. However, pay close attention to EVERYTHING in the video. I had to repeat a 25 minute section because I said a driver's shirt was gray when it was blue! Also, one question was when my car's registration expired. I missed that one by a month! I just pay it when it comes in the mail. There were questions to verify that you were who you said you were, and I guess the registration question was one of those. Overall, it was a quick, easy, cheap way to take Def.

I benefitted from the reviewing of proper driving techniques and practices and the segment regarding impaired driving is very sobering and has a lasting, positive affect on the student based on the outcome potential of drinking/using while driving. I found it very convenient to be able to take the course in time intervals that met my work schedule and the details taken by the producers of the program made life easy, no digital snafus or problems whatsoever. I highly recommend this course for anyone who needs it or simply wants to improve their driving practices.

The information on drinking and driving I thought was very informative. The section on how to conduct yourself when getting pulled over was good.

The downside of this course was that I did not find anything funny even though it was a ""Comedy Defensive Driving."" I thought it was in bad taste when the video poked fun at the individual who was struck by a car. That can be left out. Yes it was a cartoon. But in this is a defensive driving course.

Due to insurance purposes regarding a discount, I decided to come back to Comedy Driving, Inc.

I applied the knowledge I gained from this class to my daily driving and elated to say that I avoided hitting a bicyclist riding against traffic, on the sidewalk, as I was exiting my work parking lot. Like the class stresses, look left, look right and then left again Good thing I looked right, otherwise, the consequences would've been devastating. Great class!

I enjoyed the class. Sometimes the jokes came off as a little too corny/cheesy, other times I did not see what was coming and got a genuine laugh.

In some cases the videos had trouble loading or they would glitch out, which worried me as I knew I couldn't hit the back button or I would lose my progress.

It's not all comedy. Some very important and informative topics are shown, such as the loss of life due to drinking and driving or texting and driving. I really do believe people need to see the impact that such issues can cause.

The best part, sometimes the voiceovers are impersonations of characters from animated comedies such as Family Guy and South Park (ex: Joe Swanson and Mr. Mackey).

Keith,0.8,"FOUR STAR

FOUR STAR: Although I am confident that Comedy Driving (CD) improved my driving skills and I drive safer now by far—both worth FIVE STARS. My only qualms with CD is with the stereotypical depiction of 'hillbillies' with derogatory settings. Really, at every turn (pun intended) CD has a 'country boy' making dumb moves and saying stupid things. I am sure there was no insult intended and it does support the comedy theme, but the problem being: IT'S NOT FUNNY !",US,2,2021-01-21T17:36:52Z,"Comedy Driving, Inc."

MISTY,0.6,"I would use the term ""comedy"" loosely

I would use the term ""comedy"" loosely. If by comedy you mean awfully acted cartoon characters that were more annoying than anything, then ok. I expected more of a stand-up style course. The questions were also frustrating. You watch a video on say, traffic signals and you are paying attention to many numbers and figures they are spamming you with - trying to focus on key words for the questions they may ask, yet when you get to the question is it irrelevant like what color shirt was the guy on the bike wearing that you saw for maybe 3 seconds of a 90 second video and he just breezed past. Or ""what mile marker did the accident occur on"" when it was barely shown and not pointed out to begin with. I would not take this course again.",US,1,2021-01-21T17:22:33Z,"Comedy Driving, Inc."

Expectations weren't high that anything could be done or at least not in the time frame but greatly surprised that the support desk emailed back a corrected certificate THAT DAY at 6:52.
Outstanding, especially for a weekend service. It is now a mandatory requirement that my teenage son go through the course before he begins driving to supplement anything else he learns, the info is that helpful. Highly recommend the course!",US,1,2021-01-21T12:35:21Z,"Comedy Driving, Inc."

I think the fact that you're expecting to be entertained, it helps with the boredom of watching videos and PowerPoint type presentations for 6 hrs.

I could honestly answer the questions without going through instructions. But the way this course is set up, it forces you to focus on every aspect.

Best aspect is that you can take your time, and finish at your own pace. Some of the comedy was actually funny, and some of it was pretty corny.

-1 for voices. Jokes and can be funny without having to be stupid:)

I can honestly say that the accounts given in the program were honest, relatable, and very awe-inducing. The way I'll be driving in the future will absolutely be different because of the guidance this program provided for me in regards to reflecting on a very big part of my life. I didn't feel belittled or awful. I just felt like there were individuals out there who were taking the time to send me a very real message because they care about my life and others. I don't know that many people take a defensive driving course as seriously as I did but I think they should. I refuse to text anymore. I am reaffirmed in my decisions to simply not drink. And, I will be diligent about my focus and and my driving. The course not only changed a very big chunk of my life but it honestly may have provided me with the necessary reflections that could save my life. I'm glad I took this course.

Ami Soliz (Ami's Honest Reviews),1.0,"Entertaining and Informative

This was my first time taking a defensive driving course and it was pretty entertaining for an educational course. Even my 11 and 12 year olds would come and and watch some of the cartoon parts to laugh and ask me to rewind it for them (which is start over since you can't really fast forward or rewind). I feel like I learned or re-learned a lot for that matter and got clarity on some changes that have happened since I was taught to drive. There's no way to cheat, not pay attention, or have someone else do it for you since it has test questions that require a response within 90 seconds along with random verification questions so you don't really know when it will ask.",US,1,2018-01-31T05:08:04Z,"Comedy Driving, Inc."

Wendy Fair,0.8,"Good basic driving course

This course was simple and straight-forward. It does take about 6-8 hours to complete and has a built in 1 hour break requirement. The up side is you can complete this as a required course online and not have to spend a day in a classroom somewhere. The only down side I encountered is you run into complications when signing up if you don't have a vehicle plate number registered in TX. You can still sign up, but takes a little longer as you must print out and send in a signed form before you can start the course. If you're a planner no worries! If you are a procrastinator, probably not the best solution.

I am very old school and don't even own a cell phone myself, but I see every day many people that are using their phones and trying to drive at the same time in a fashion that is obvious that they can not multi task.

Comedy Driving Review

Thanks for the opportunity to send more feedback for the course taken. There are a few items that I would like to relay to you.

1. Having a son who's just recently gone through the driving education for Texas as provided by a private entity, there were several items that both he and I noted as contrary to what is being taught in the driving schools. One item was the hand position on the steering wheel. Not what is being taught. There were several other items. It would be beneficial for you to have a private entity who is approved by the TxDoT to review your content.
2. Also noted and vocalized by my son the following observation was made. With the recent racial (over)sensitivities in our contemporary culture today, it seems that there is quite a bit of 'fun' made of stereotypical elements of ""some"" parts of the ""white"" culture. The best way to ask yourselves if something seems racist is to replace different or other races in your scenario and see if it still seems appropriate. Your choices of whom to ridicule, though acceptable in current pop culture, comes off as inappropriate, offensive and racist.
3. The trick questions involved in the ""Intersections"" section were unnecessary. I understand that you are wanting to be sure that the attendee is being attentive to the videos. However, with my first missed test question - and I don't have the question in front of me to validate - was what vehicle the ""cop"" (police officer) was using when going 'through' the intersection. In the video, the officer on motorcycle didn't completely go ""through"" the intersection. Trick question. The second missed test question had to do with what what was the first video in the session. I believe that I answered ""people stopping at the intersection"" which was in the introduction and it was counted wrong. I'm guessing in retrospect that the 'correct' answer was the crashes. Perhaps I'm not remembering correctly, but this is what I recall. Again, these types of questions seemed ""trick"" and had no relation to the aspect of ""safe driving"".

Morgan Garrett,1.0,"Mostly entertaining, only sometimes grueling

This is a great way to experience this class. It's just entertaining enough to sit hours through without being so nuanced you can't peel your eyes away without missing something.

There are a few places where it's lacking.

1. The inertia section with Albert Einstein is brutal. I have a masters degree and I couldn't help but fall asleep.

2. The documentaries are so cheesy. Like the texting and driving and drunk driving - omg, I wanted to blow my brains out.

Everything was clear and simple - I think having a Script at bottom of every slide for those of us that like to read not just listen would be helpful.",US,1,2017-09-15T00:53:24Z,"Comedy Driving, Inc."

This is the first time I've used Comedy Driving. It's so much better than other courses I've used in the past, that I wish I could give Comedy 6 stars. It was easy to sign up... The course picked up exactly where I left off every time I logged in... It worked great on my iPhone, so I was able to do the course whenever I had a few minutes. I had ZERO problems!!! I divided the course over 3 days, and it felt like much shorter than 6 hours of course time--it went by fast. The test questions were fair and not difficult to answer if you paid attention. Each topic of the course was divided into short videos (a minute or two long) which made it easy to pay attention. Some of the characters were really cute... Listen carefully for some clever double entendres and word play. I have only one issue with the course: all the instructor characters were MALE. I would have liked to see female instructors, too!!

I have done both comedy and non-comedy online defensive driving. I find the non-comedy preferable....I do NOT find the comedy that funny. It felt very childish, and not because of the cartoons. I teach theatre, so I am used to different accents and voices of characters. Yet, I found some of the character's accents/character voices here made them very hard to understand (and there was no pause or back button on some of the videos to go back and listen again).
Another thing that I did NOT like....I felt that the test questions weren't always about the knowledge portion of the laws and safety rules. Some questions seemed to just be checking to see if you really watched the movies (Ie: what was the cop driving in the movie).
There was also a section of test questions that didn't count against us. I know that for some, I definitely entered the correct response (I also teach Health, which includes a chapter on alcohol that i do in depth with students). Some, I didn't even click on anything, and they buzzed as incorrect.
Finally, I did not find the alcohol game to be funny at all. If it isn't timed, why include it?!?!?!",US,1,2017-08-21T00:44:13Z,"Comedy Driving, Inc."

Valorie,0.8,"Drive with Comedy

I have taken an online driving class 2 other times in the last 12 years. This one seemed to go by much faster and not so much info trying to be said in a short amount of time. It seems some driving classes want to show off how much info they are teaching, I would say not say "" teaching"" is the right word, just blasting off as much info as fast as possible your mind can't take it all in, and you end up not retaining any of it. This one has reasonable amounts of info and some you just read, that helps to with not getting bored. I found the texting stories mini documentaries, obviously sad, however informative and alarming! I hope that part sticks! I plan to be far more aware of how often I am guilty of any cell activity while driving and STOP . The humor is silly, but that's the point. For what ever reason I did not find it as mind numbing as I thought it would be. The questions come right after the topic, so no way to forget or fail and if you miss a question for what ever reason, it allows you to go back and watch section again not entire hour, just that section. Then will ask you a different question, like what color was a drivers shirt. I found that a bit annoying and irrelevant. All in all I would say go with this one. Easy to access on any device.

Bethany Eakle,0.8,"I would recommend it

I don't think there is a defensive driving course in existence that is super fun to attend. However, this one was relatively easy to sit through and actually provided me with some information I didn't already know. There are a couple of chapters that include real life stories of people (in texting and drunk driving accidents) which helped me to connect.

There is a timer on each screen that lets you know how long you must remain on that page (so people can't rush through the course without actually listening to the information). Sometimes the content of the page would finish 10-15 seconds before you were allowed to click to the next page. That was annoying but ultimately did not make a big difference. I could log in and out as I pleased, so I could complete the course in my own time. Four or five questions appear at the end of each chapter, so there is not one large exam at the end. I didn't think the course was super funny, but I think it was better than the one my husband took (which he said was extremely dry).

Sophia,1.0,"An awakening moment

This is my first time taking this course and I found it very informative. In my opinion I felt I needed this review because I have been driving since age 16 and never received a speeding ticket and it's not because of not speeding at one time or another but never got caught. The information given throughout this course awakened me to the very actions I have taken while driving not being aware of the 2 second rule, hydroplaning, ABS, seat adjustment while driving, etc. I am aware I cannot control what others do while driving but given this information has given me what not to do when approached by someone raging or vehicles driving up close to me. Safety first and live now is what I have taken from this course. many thanks for the illustrations, jokes and taking the time out to show me the real meaning of our privilege to drive.

Zina Thomas,1.0,"Re-Sensitizing

I really appreciate this Comedy Driving Course in that it made me more sensitive to ""What could happen if..."". The if's is what we need to consider while putting our keys in the door of our vehicles BEFORE starting the engine, thus making us become more conscious of our surroundings and taking others into consideration when setting out to drive. I would recommend this course as a Graduating Requirement for Seniors of high school as well as a Recomendend Refresh Coarse after 10-15 years of getting a license, because even pros need re-sensitizing. 😊

Stella Hawkins Smith,1.0,"Totally awesome

I cannot say enough good about this course. There is no final which takes a lot of pressure off. You only have 3 questions to answer after each section which also takes the pressure off and let's face it, taking these courses can be very frustrating. They give you a lot of good information, yet you don't have to try to remember every little detail because the questions are presented in a way that you just have to use common sense after having been presented with the information. They don't try to give you too much information at a time and then expect you to remember every little detail. I tried two other online courses before I found this one, and they had me sweating bullets. Logging in and out at your own leisure was good. Although the other courses had this feature as well, being under the pressure of having to take a final made you feel as if you had to finish the course as soon as possible as to not forget any of the information. This course, once you were finished with a section, you were done with it. You could go on to the next section not all tensed up. Thank you, thank you, thank you for the course.

So I got into an accident- my fault. My first accident in 30 some years and what you go through afterwards is even more frustrating than the accident itself. I'd contracted with another company and completed about a quarter of the course. I ran into problems trying to log in where I'd stopped, trying to go back to recap and review, and finally, trying to communicate with the technicians for help. And the content? Please, I was bored and felt the presentation of content was more for elementary kids. I was willing to take a loss and quit that company. That experience sent me searching for another company when I found Comedy Driving, inc. I had one issue which was immediately address. I spoke to two technicians and my issue was handled without further ado.
The content was excellent. I was never bored, nor did I feel ""talked down to"". The content was easy to follow and it gave me a greater sense of security while driving. Just reviewing things I took for granted made me a better driver. I am more relaxed and not in a hurry. I'm more aware of my surroundings as I drive and certainly more polite.
