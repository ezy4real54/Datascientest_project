I was handed the keys, charged $37, and told “You’re all set.”
I got out to the car and saw that the 2023 inspection sticker was not affixed. After I went back I was told Car failed inspection based on an emission issue. I should have been told before I got in my car and started to drive.",US,1,2022-08-16T17:31:56Z,Mavis Discount Tire
MICHAEL TOMPKINS,1.0,"Weekend Service

I brought my car for service on Sunday morning. That evening I was not able to pick it up by closing time. I called the manager and was assured that it was okay to leave it. I felt comfortable to leave it because of the relationship that I have established with Mavis. I highly recommend the Mavis on Dallas Highway to anyone who wants to be sure they will get great service at a fair price! The manager, Jeff, will make sure that your car runs as it should!! All the workers give you the sense that they care, and highly respect their customers.",US,1,2022-08-16T04:59:28Z,Mavis Discount Tire

Went to Mavis in New Milford CT. for a oil change with no appointment. Mike the service Mgr. said he could squeeze me in. To my amazement my car was in the bay in 10 minutes.

1894 Central ave Colonie NY location. Made appointment for 4 new tires, they up sold me an alignment and valve stems. they had the car on the lift for around 45 minutes and then pulled it out, guy at counter yells out I’m all set. I ask how was the alignment done on a 2 post lift and not on the alignment rack… oops, he rus out and tells tech it needs an alignment as well. after around 1 hour twenty minutes total I was out the door, and the car was tracking straight, everything seemed good. Almost home and the steering was getting a little vague, odd… lift up the front end and find the jam nuts that lock the tie tod end links in place were LOOSE!, yep loose. I look at the other work “done” and notice the valve stems were not replaced. call the manager, he agrees to refund the valve stems and that’s is, they offer to fix the alignment. no way I’m letting them touch any of my cars again. wasted an hour driving back and home again, not to metion gas for the valve stem refund. my advice stay away from this location, it seems that the manager is either not paying attention to what the techs are doing or they are just ripping people off.",US,2,2022-08-16T21:10:21Z,Mavis Discount Tire

He even stated that he wouldn’t want to bring it back to the shop that messed it up the first time. When I brought my car in to be looked at last week, as my local mechanic, I did not know what the problem was. After finding out that the breaks needed to be replaced, that is when I reached back out to Mavis for a second time.

Tara Brochu,0.2,"0 stars is sadly not an option here

0 stars is sadly not an option here, I am currently sitting in the store at 9pm at night 9 hours after I dropped my car off to be serviced. It is still sitting on the lift with nothing being worked on and my rim sitting on the floor. I was originally quoted 2-3 hours then when I arrived the riverhead location I was quoted 4-5 hours because “there are quite a few cars ahead of me”. Ahead of my appointment I might add, A time that is supposed to be reserved for my car to be serviced, at mavis tire an appointment means your car will be sitting in the lot until 10 mins before the location closes. The front desk was not accommodating besides disrespectful remarks to my 19 yr old self and my mother and in addition discriminating remarks to their employees.

Anthony, Preacher, and the entire team at this store are consistently top notch. I regularly have 2 cars serviced at their Phenix City Mavis location. They are the most friendly and kind automotive repair folks I know. My family has previously owned an auto repair facility, and I am aware that not all large chains are trustworthy, however, I have complete confidence in the staff at this Mavis location. I highly recommend them, and as long as the current team members remain there, I will in turn remain a loyal customer. An auto repair facility chain is only as good as it’s people, and while I can’t speak for all stores, this one in Phenix City will continue to exceed expectations as long as they provide incentives to keep their current team onboard and as long as those employees continue providing their excellent customer service.",US,1,2022-07-28T23:33:36Z,Mavis Discount Tire

Could not ask for better service. I have a history with the manager at this store. Earlier this year, at one of your acworth stores, we got really bad service on my wife's car. This manager came over and took control of that store to get it back where it needed to be. He personally came to my house and took care of my wifes car. When I went back later to get two new tires, they had a new manager, and the service went straight back to crappy. I had a flat this morning, and I drive for a living so every second costs me money. This store was the closest to get to. I pulled up and he came out and asked how he could help. Him and his guy jumped right on it, and I was back on the road in less than 20 minutes. This gentleman has won my loyalty and service. I can't really give glowing remarks about my other Mavis services of the past. He really gives Mavis a great name.

JOSE ACEVEDO,0.4,"Wish they would have told me about the oil drain bolt before starting the job.

Generally, I'm very happy with the service I get at this Mavis tires shop. Monday however I brought the car in to have the cover under the engine resecured. I also asked that they check the oil level. I was informed that the engine oil level was low and was asked as to whether I would like an oil change. I agreed knowing that the car burns oil and waited about an hour or so. Upon completion of the job, I was told that they were unable to remove the drain bolt and drain all the oil. I was given a discount for the oil change, but I would have preferred to have been notified prior to the start of the job so I could have decided whether or not it was worth paying for an incomplete oil change. Under such circumstances I could have purchased 2 quarts of oil and refill the motor on my own while saving a few bucks. I was also told by the mechanic who serviced the car that he used regular oil to fill the motor while the attendant behind the desk informed me that synthetic oil for cars with high mileage was used. I left the place a little uneasy not knowing the long-term effects accumulated oil sludge may have on the engine. Hopefully in the future I'll be able to find a mechanic that will be able to remove the drain bolt so I can get a complete oil change.",US,1,2022-08-04T02:16:28Z,Mavis Discount Tire

Chris,0.2,"Take your car ANYWHERE ELSE

Took car in on Sunday (Tallahassee, Fl.) to have screw removed as no other shops were open. Paid $33.21 (Highest price around). Took car home afterwards. Monday morning discover they never even removed the screw. Wife took car in Monday afternoon, they remove screw and patched tire. Tuesday We discover there's a missing lug nut and a broken lug bolt. Manager offers to pay for repair or they will repair it (probably because they already have other reviews where they've broken lug bolts off). No thanks, I'll take it elsewhere and you can pay. Thursday take receipt for repair in, manager hands wife some money, she counts it it's short. Tells manager, he gives her some more money, STILL NOT the correct amount. On the third try it gets the correct amount and we are DONE with Mavis Forever. In the manager's defense though regarding counting out the money. He may not have actually been trying to short us, it could be because every phone line they have is occupied with customer's also complaining about the shoddy work this company does.",US,1,2022-07-28T17:42:26Z,Mavis Discount Tire

Skipper Ladnier,0.2,"Zero (0) Star…!

Approximately 9-10 months ago, visited store to get alignment, rotation, balance. Was told I needed to replace my tires…and, because of that need, they wouldn’t do alignment. Huh…!

Recently made appointment for 2:30pm next day. I had to put down a deposit (not much…$25) for this. Upon arrival, they told me my appointment was for 1pm. Huh? Read confirming email they sent (which I had not read…why read a confirming email…?). Email “confirmed” appointment was set for 8am. Huh!

Next…They would Not honor mileage warranty on current tires…said I had to do that thru the manufacturer. (Yes. I purchased current set of tires from Kauffman - the previous owner). They did not tell me this when I inquired (when making appointment) about warranty adjustment. Also…Previous owner (Kauffman) would adjust my cost based on warranty.

I asked for a refund of my deposit. They said a credit would come thru in a couple days. We’ll see.

I did Not purchase from Mavis this time. There are two chances that I will ever purchase from Mavis. And “slim” just left town. Same chances apply to whether I would recommend Mavis…!!!",US,2,2022-07-29T18:37:51Z,Mavis Discount Tire

Charles Love,0.2,"Deceptive Pricing

My tire had a slow leak. I took it to Mavis Tire University at 8040 North Tryon St. Charlotte. I was told that the tire had a nail in the side wall and could not be fixed. I would need to buy a new tire. (Goodyear Assurance All Season) I inquired as to how much it would cost after warranty had been applied that I purchased the tire at this store and had another tire replaced from the same set of the four new tires that I had purchased at this store. I was told that the tire did not have a warranty and that I was just told that it had a warranty because I was a good customer. He told me that the tire that I needed cost $169.99 but he would discount it by $25.00 and the price of the tire would be $144.99. At check out, I was told that my total bill came to 199.99. I asked how could that be? I was given a price of $144.99 prior to authorizing the purchase and where was the $25.00 discount that I had been given. He then told me that the tire cost $199.99 and that the $169.99 reflected the discounted cost. I told him that $25.00 subtracted from $199.99 was $174.99. He could not explain this computation. I told him that he had performed a bait and switch technique on me, that his tactics were deceptive and that I would not be coming back ever again. I went home and checked the price of the tire that I purchased on the Mavis Website and the price of the price of the tire is $127.00. I should have asked to see the damaged tire as I don't see how one could run over a nail from the side of the tire. I now don't believe that the tire was damaged beyond repairs

They said they broke the cover off and would have to order a new one. I will go back tomorrow for the 4th visit.

1st. Appointment for 07/16/22 at 09:00 - Drop the car at 08:55am.

2nd. No status until I called (2:30pm) and asked.. Answer: We cannot pull out the wheels, because YOUR wheel lock is bad.

3rd. Went to the store, pickup the keys and looked around the car, this is what I found:
Front Right Side, missing the Wheel Lock Bolt
Front Left Side - Wheel Lock completely damaged.

4th. I went inside the store and call the attendant to go see the issues, answer: ""Yes, this is because YOUR key damaged when we tried to remove the lock""

All this waste time for the Mavis final answer: We damaged your car, we broke something, we cannot fix and the fault is YOURS.

Again, do not do the same mistake I did, what mistake? Take the car to MAVIS.",US,1,2022-07-17T00:20:36Z,Mavis Discount Tire

If I could leave ZERO stars I would. Where do I even start.
1)Left car for set up appointment to be called hours later stating tires were not in stock. Called hours later to say car was done.
2)when picked up, tire on all four tires ranged from 22-40 lbs, could not print me out a receipt, did not give instructions for $70 mail in rebate, told me I could take a picture of computer bill which was an incorrect amount that I was charged.
3)Took car on a trip and car shook very much. Took back to Mavis to learn tires were not balanced.
4)Then Had to go back to get a copy of reciept because michelin online rebate would not accept picture of computer receipt.
5)went back again to Mavis for a refund of the other $70 rebate that was to come off invoice but did not.
6)Took car to acura because my tire pressure monitoring system showed system failure multiple times after new tires were installed. Acura state that they broke one of the sensors AND MAVIS INSTALLED THE DIRECTIONAL TIRES IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. $400 later, tires mounted properly and sensor changed at Acura
7)Called 800 number to complain and corporate was mortified and apologetic and will possibly cover some or all of my expenses due to their incompetance.",US,1,2022-07-16T20:51:01Z,Mavis Discount Tire

customer,0.2,"MAVIS in Lindenhurst, NY

MAVIS in Lindenhurst, NY is easily the worst experience anyone could have regarding new tires and replacement brakes. I ordered 4 new tires 5 days in advance of my appointment, being assured while ordering, the day before the appointment, and the day of the appointment that all 4 tires would arrive. After verbally confirming all 4 tires were there the day of the appointment (Saturday), about 1 hour afterwards I received a call that only 3 of 4 tires were there and that the 4th would arrive ""any time"" on Monday and that I needed to bring the car back. 3 of 4 tires were replaced that Saturday, along with rear brakes. I was told on Monday after bringing my car back for the 4th tire to be replaced, that the 2 rear tires did not have a place for the sensors (which is incorrect) and therefore the sensors were not replaced. Additionally, MAVIS broke the tire valve stem on the 4th tire that Monday, and refused to look at that particular tire once I alerted them that day, as well as twice within the week upon noticing the air pressure continued to decrease with each drive. They assured me it was my own fault for hitting a pot hole, which is false. Additionally, they did not do an alignment as they claimed they did. I had to take it to the dealer who informed me that the 4th tire valve was completely broken off, causing the leak - which was apparently broken during the tire replacement that Monday. Shame on MAVIS. Additionally, the dealership noticed that the rear sensors were missing, and replaced them, of course at at additional cost. Between the inaccuracy and lies of the tire shipment, the lack of knowledge regarding the tire sensors, and the obvious valve tire valve breaking during their service, and of course the poor customer service, servicing my car at MAVIS proved to be an incredibly costly and horrific experience I do not wish upon anyone.

David Price,0.2,"Go somewhere else!

On Wednesday, July 6th, 2022 I made an appointment for Saturday, July 9th @ 9:00AM to have my car PA State Inspected. I dropped the car off at 8:00AM July 9th and was told my car would be ready at noon, and they would call. At 1:00PM I called Mavis (because they did not call) and they said that they had been busy and were just pulling my car in and it would be an hour and a half and they would call. At 2:30PM (still no call), my wife dropped me off at the Dresher Mavis. My car had not been moved from the spot that I parked it in at 8:00AM. I inquired at the counter as to why my car hadn’t been inspected and why I was not called. The counter person stated that my car was not due for inspection and they couldn’t do it. I explained that it WAS due and I wanted it inspected. The counter person double checked and agreed it was due BUT asked if I now wanted it done. I stated that I did and that was why I made the appointment. I stated that I now was going to wait rather than leave again. At 3:00PM they pulled my car into the garage and performed the inspection.
I have used STS-Mavis Dresher for over ten years for inspections, oil changes, and tire purchases. This experience was horrible! I was lied to, deceived and treated as if I was bothering the business. While I was waiting three other customers (with appointments) were waiting hours past their appointment time for service. One customer became very frustrated and was verbally abusive to the staff. Although it was uncalled for, I can sympathize.

He said “we’re doing the best we can”. Left for 2 hours and came back. Car still wasn’t looked at. Manager again ignored my question of how much longer? Then proceeded to get in his car and left.

Half way home the car started making club king noises where they replaced the suspension. I made it home and took it to my local Mavis. Come to find out they did not replace all of the broken parts, and DID NOT PUT BACK all of the parts.

Could not be more upset about the service here, it’s just incredible the lack of professionalism.
My wife made an appointment for an oil change, balance wheels because they are out of balance and check two of the tires for leaks as they are low (I believe the valve stems are leaking).
She goes to pickup the car and the guy at the front desk said they only did the oil change, didn‘t have time to find the key lock for the wheels (they were the last to use it a few months back when tires were installed and didn’t put it back). Now I’m on the hook for a new key lock…
Sent a mother with her young kids off with the low tire warning light STILL on, didn’t have the courtesy to fill up the tires. Never put a new oil sticker in the car, and a day later the low washer fluid light came on which means they didn’t even top off fluids. at this point I’m not even convinced they even did the oil change! Over $100 for total disappointment.

Alan Dubrinsky,0.6,"Quote over the phone not Honored at the Alpharetta Mavis Tire Shop

I called Mavis today and spoke to Brian who quoted me $249 for the two tires installed. When I got to the Alpharetta Store, Vithun K says he can't honor the Price that Brian quoted because there are extra fees that Brian did not mention and my cost would be $275. I needed the job completed that day so I begrudgingly agreed to go ahead. In addition, Vithun says they checked the alignment and it needed to be aligned and we agreed to $100 for the alignment for a total for ties and alignment of $377.43. After the job was completed, Vithun told me had had to change the invoice numbers a bit but it would still be as Vithun quoted me $377.43. In addition to the price issue between Brian's phone quote and Vithun at the shop, the Technicians did not put the correct tire pressure in either of the new tires they installed and they did not replace the plastic cap on the drivers side rear tire. Additionally, they did not check the tire pressure on the front tires that were not replaced by Mavis today and those pressures were incorrect.
Evan though the price difference is only $28 between Brian's quote over and Vithun at the shop, I feel that Vithun should have honored the price quoted by Brian. I was charged extra for Balancing, TPMS Service, misc shop supplies and tire recycling.
The last two tires I had from Rick Case Hyundai cost Set of 2, fully installed = $242.88 and includes everything plus a 24 month Road Hazard Warranty.
I thought I would give Mavis a try today but I would have done better just going my local Rick Case Hyundai Dealer. With this type of run-around, I will not likely return to Mavis if this is the way the company does business.",US,2,2022-07-03T23:02:46Z,Mavis Discount Tire

Seras,0.2,"Asked for brakes, wasted 4 hours of my day

Asked for brakes, tried to upsell me for rotors and brakes. Their excuse, oh i assumed you meant the rotors too cause thats what everyone asks for. They didnt even have the brakes on site, waited 3 hours for a advanced autoparts shuttle to deliver brakes when they said it would be there within the hour. The car sat 2.5 hours before it was ever looked at(the place wasnt busy).

When the brakes finnally arrived, I was told i didnt need brakes, tried to suggest i buy a part that they dont install. Turns out my brake fluid was low.

They had the hardest time trying to figure out what was supposed to happen with my car even though they had the sheet telling them what to do, they even asked me a few times what was supposed to be done with the car. They bleeded the lines to my brakes to remove any possible air in the lines, but claimed my wheels where locked up. They didnt even know how to disable an electronic emergency brake.

They even offer small monitary discounts to those who place 5star good reviews on their page. 4 hours of being there and waiting, i finally got my car back. Just a fluid resivor issue(needed filled)

The only positive note, the staff is friendly. Everyone there seems like they dont know what their doing. They even had the hardest time working the printer to give me my reciept. They had to give me one they printed up several hours prior and had me scratch off what they didnt do for me to see what they actually did.

Brought my truck up to Mavis Discount Tire in walkertown today for a quick alignment. First thing they do is hop in my truck and rev it as soon as they started it. (I have a loud truck so i can definitely hear it ). All said and done they couldn’t perform the alignment because of the size of my truck. I walk out to meet them as they back off the alignment rack and they managed to disregard the trailer sitting in the parking lot and so very lucky barely tapped the trailer with my rear bumper. So if anyone is considering their shop i strongly advise someone else. Kinda disappointing that a nice shop like this has such terrible service.",US,1,2022-07-01T02:35:04Z,Mavis Discount Tire

Katy Jabs,0.2,"UNACCEPTABLE and UNPROFESSIONAL customer service and blatant lack of response/communication.

I bought a brand new car (2022) that I picked up on Friday. On Sunday, I had to travel out of town to pick my daughter up. About an hour on the trip, I got a flat tire after driving over something very sharp. I called Triple A and they put on my spare. I drove to a Mavis that was a few miles away in Scranton, PA. Mavis told me that they could not replace one tire because they did not have it in stock. They also told me that it would be extremely unsafe for me to drive on a spare to get back home an hour away. Therefore, they told me that I needed to replace ALL FOUR TIRES on my brand new car that had only 88 miles on it. In addition, they linked the invoice to my old car (that had already been traded in), stating they were unable to input a new car into their system. Due to the fact that at this time I had my daughter with me, and the man telling me we wouldn't be safe driving on the spare AND that doing so would ruin my brand new car, I felt stranded and strongly pressured to buy four new tires. I spent almost $1000 after buying this brand new car two days previous. In addition, the man tried to get me to buy an extended warranty on these tires!! Which I did NOT. On Monday, I spoke to Toyota service and they told me I was completely duped. The spare tire said very clearly on the tire that I could drive it as long as I was going below 60 mph and that I could have most certainly driven an hour back home and figured out the situation the next day. The service person also told me that for them to say this would ruin my brand new car, with only 88 miles on it, was absolutely ludicrous. In addition, the fact that Mavis linked the work to my old car was also criminal in the sense that Toyota, nor Mavis, nor anyone, could ever do anything to help with an invoice that had completely inaccurate information about the car that was being serviced. He strongly suggested that I contact Mavis Headquarters and demand a reimbursement for three tires as there is no reason they should have told me I needed them. I called Mavis Headquarters on Monday, 6/27 and spoke to a woman who said the Regional Manager of the Scranton location would call me back that day. He didn't. I called back late that afternoon and was told again that he'd call me. He didn't. I called Tuesday morning, following up and saying I never got a call from the Regional Manager. She confirmed she got a hold of him, that he'd looked at my report and would be calling me that day to work things out. He didn't. Tuesday afternoon, my husband called to follow up. The woman said in addition to leaving another message with the Regional Manager, she would also contact his boss due to the lack of correspondence. No calls back from either person. On Wednesday 6/29, my husband called again and spoke to a different man. This one told us that the regional manager had left for the day but that he would DEFINITELY call me back first thing Thursday morning, 6/30. He did not call. My husband called again and was assured I would be getting a call right away. It's 11:30am on Thursday and I have received no call. Now it is obvious to me that they are blatantly ignoring and avoiding my complaint. This is absolutely unacceptable, unprofessional, and questionable behavior. UPDATE--No call Thursday, no call Friday. My husband had to angrily call for a 10th time where he finally connected with the regional manager, who was abrupt and dismissive. After demanding that he finally call me, he did. He was abrupt, did not listen to the issue, placed blame and was unwilling to come to any sort of compromise or agreement to resolve the issue. I will never go to Mavis again and will be cancelling the credit card I had to open for four new tires. This was a completely outrageous experience.",US,1,2022-07-01T17:00:34Z,Mavis Discount Tire

I told him that I'd rather wait until next month as I am on a fixed income and collecting SS. Later that evening I received a call saying that my truck was ready. When I asked for the 'damages' (what my cost was) he said, ""$1404.24"" This was far and away from what I had been quoted and what I wanted to do, what I was able and willing to do. Leaving me NO choice, I had to dig into my meager savings and pay the bill the next morning. I will NOT be returning to Mavis Tire. I will also lodge a complaint with the BBB and tell all and sundry to be wary of Mabvis on Tyrone Blvd. in St. Pete.",US,2,2022-06-24T18:59:27Z,Mavis Discount Tire

Pearl,0.2,"Where do I start

Where do I start! This location is on Jimmy Carter in Norcross, GA. On Juneteenth my low tire censor came on and I pulled over and noticed that my tire was FLAT. The nearest tire shop was - you guessed it - Mavis. It was 4:37pm and they closed at 5pm, so I had to leave my car overnight. Tevin called me on Monday morning to advise that they did not have a tech./mechanic so my vehicle will be ready to go on Tues. This is where the DRAMA begins. On Tues morning the store manager Tenecia calls to confirm the work to be done to my car. She even upsold me on 4 new tires. The overall quote was approx. $1800 - cool. Since she called at 9am and my car was there since SUNDAY - June 19th, I'm thinking my car would be 1st in line. Wishful thinking. I called up there at 4:30pm to check on the status of my vehicle and a female informs me that they are working on my vehicle. Me thinking - my car has been there for the past 2days, and they close at 6pm let me go up there because they should be nearly done, if not done by the time I get there. I take an Uber and let them know that I was there to pick up my vehicle. The Store Manager - Tenecia says - I was going to call you when your vehicle was ready, so I walk around to check on the progress of my vehicle and NO work, let me repeat NO work had been done to my vehicle. At this time, it was already 6pm and closing time. I walk back up to the front and me and a female in training walk back to my vehicle and the ONLY tech/mechanic in the shop that was working on another veh. was now working on my veh. At this point I am extremely upset, because I was LIED to by Tenecia. But the lies did not stop there. I should have gone with my first mind and just take my car but when she said that the work (4tires, rear brakes, flush, rear shocks, alignment, balance) could be done in 1.5hrs. I had to see this lie through - so I agreed. Her team was either going to impress me or confirm that she is the type of manager that will lie her way to the top. She proved the later. When Tenecia thought the coast was clear she and her ""manager in training"" LEFT. Now mind you, the work was suppose to take 1.5hr so at 7:30p I checked in with Tevin and Brian the mechanic who were honest and professional and advised - it was going to take much longer. Tevin, was so kind to check in on me often which I appreciated and he informed me that they ONLY had 1 tire and not the 4 that Tenecia upsold me (she could not ensure that I had all 4 tires) shameful. Lets review the LIES Tenecia has told so far: 1. Tech is working on your car - that was a lie, 2. It will only take 1.5hrs - that was a lie, 3. We have 4 tires in stock - that was a lie, 4. I was going to call you when he was done - that was a lie. Unless she meant call me on Wednesday. But this is not even the icing on the cake. When Tevin and I was going over my charges, since he had to make major adjustments - I learned that the Store Manager Tenecia added windshield wiper blades just to adjust them off. In accounting we call this cooking the books and is SOOOOO illegal and how ENRON went under. I know this is not on ENRON level, she is still misleading her management up stream to assume she is meet/exceeding expectation when she is NOT. When I saw the windshield wiper blades I wanted Tevin to explain but he could/would not. I managed a store in my previous life and I know that stores have quotes but to cook the books as if you are selling windshield wipers is down right LOW. Lying to get ahead and I am sure she is showing that to the ""new trainee"". SAD! The worst part is how she through Tevin under the bus by saying ""it was all his fault"" that me veh. was not ready - not sure if she was joking but that is her store and she needed to own up to my vehicle not being ready. Due to this economy the number 1 asset an organization has is its employees and they should be treated like gold. I hope those guys are being compensated well because jobs are a dime a dozen in this market. Guess what time I walked out of Mavis on Jimmy Carter - 9:30pm, when I dropped my car off on Sunday. I have no idea how Tenecia was promoted to Store Manager- I take that back her numbers are amazing because she is cooking the books. Mavis, you should audit her transactions i.e. store for debit/credit transactions on customers receipts (windshield wiper blades transactions). Tevin should be in training to run his own store one day because he has the soft skills needed to make ppl follow him and Brian is simply AMAZNG, The tenacity, focus and hard working skills that young man displayed makes me want to invest in him. I was the last transaction on 6/22/22 if you want to look up my infor. and contact me. Oh, I read all those kind words ppl wrote about Tenecia and I believe 0 of them.

Do not trust what they say about what your car needs! I went there for a tire. I got, what I verified was a good deal. After telling them that because of that deal I would come back for the other tire, they felt that I trusted them and they could tell me whatever they wanted. They told me that my suspension, struts, and shocks were shot and gave me an estimate for $1700, which of course I didn't have at the time. They asked that I write my review right then, so he got 5 stars because of the good tire deal. However, when I went to the dealer, and a separate mechanic the next day, I was told there was nothing whatsoever wrong with my car. A $1700 lie!

Cheryl E.,0.2,"Don't buy tires here!

Don't buy tires here if you care about rotating your tires on schedule. Over the years, I have bought many sets of tires from this location mostly when it was still Kauffman Tires. Each set of four tires included free lifetime balance and rotation. Since Mavis bought Kauffman, it has been nearly impossible to get the tires rotated on schedule. In fact, I've never been able to get the tires rotated here.

I've stopped by on half a dozen occasions to have my tires rotated only to be told they couldn't work me in or it would be a minimum 2-3 hour wait. So on my last attempt of stopping by only to be told they couldn't work me in, I finally decided to make an appointment. The earliest available appointment was four days later so I booked a time. I showed up at my scheduled time thinking I would be in and out in 30 minutes only to be told it would be a 2 hour wait! So what's the point of making an appointment?!

I'll never buy tires from here again.

UPDATE: I wrote this review while waiting to have my tires rotated. After waiting over two hours past my appointment time, I was told it would be at least another hour before they could get my car in and then another hour to rotate the tires. So best case, it would have taken 4 hours to complete a simple tire rotation. That is entirely unacceptable so I canceled and left. This is no way to do business. I will pay a PROFESSIONAL tire shop to rotate my tires.

However, if you are in a position to take half a day off of work in order to get your tires rotated, then Mavis Tires is the place you want to go!! Because it will take at least that long.",US,1,2022-06-19T21:54:15Z,Mavis Discount Tire

Barbara L. Jones,0.2,"Charged but NO Work done!

On Sunday, June 5th, 2022, my husband & daughter dropped her car off to have the wheels aligned on her car. After doing an evaluation, he was called with a laundry list of OTHER things they said were wrong with her car to include, she needs new tires (at least 2), that prevented the wheel alignment from being done & her brakes also needed to be replaced, not just turned - my husb asked if the rotors could just be turned, they said NO, & it would cost upwards of $465.00! I told him we can get cheaper tires elsewhere, Mavis quoted us $136 or $215 per tire; we picked up the car on Monday, took it to Discount tires, got 2 brand new tires for $205 total! I took it back to Mavis to get the Wheels aligned, & they said we'd get a call when it was done. After not getting a CB on Monday at all, I called Tuesday am first thing to inquire if it was ready yet? I was CB by Connie & told it was ready for pick up! I took my daughter to get her car, after she stood in line for 30 minutes, she paid for the wheel alignment, got the receipt & we attempted to leave. She noticed that her seat had not even been moved at all, & after trying to drive off only to the back of the bldg, that nothing at all had been done! And the car was still in the exact spot she had left it the day before when she drove it off! We drove it back to the bay area & a tech told her to allow him to check it, to see if it had in fact been done? He inspected it & noticed there was a bent rear control arm, & there was NO WAY a wheel align could be done in that condition. They had lied to us about doing the work & charged my daughter for work that had never been done! Not even looked at! The tech insisted she receive a full refund immediately. Which they did, but I was very disappointed in the fact they tried to take advantage of my daughter in that way! I asked Connie if they were going to do anything besides just giving her a refund & she said she would call me in the morning after she could research what had happened. She called, but I missed the call & called her back & she had no info for me. She called me back to give me a quote on the control arm of $1040.00!!! I told her it was unacceptable & I expected it to be taken care of in light of what had happened. In the meantime, my daughter is having to miss an additional day of work by all the lack of customer service she had NOT received thus far! Connie told me the owner was out of town on vacation & would not return until Monday. So I went elsewhere to have the work done for a reasonable price! My normal mechanic shop did the repair on the control arm for Only $354.00 and said the ""Brakes were fine!"" So we had been lied to twice in this while ordeal, first the NON wheel alignment, then the fact that my daughter's brakes are in GOOD repair & NO NEED of replacement as we had been advised by Mavis! ALL OF THIS nonsense is extremely unacceptable! I am in disbelief that these unethical practices still persist in 2022! I am extremely disappointed that a National chain business like Mavis Tire would try to take advantage of a young girl, as they attempted to do, & if not for having a very diligent mother, would have succeeded! I do wonder how many other non suspecting fools this has happened to in the past from this establishment? I did receive a call back today from the regional mgr., a woman named Ebony, after I made several calls to corporate for some sort of resolve, & she was very rude to me, & began to yell at me on the phone. Yes, I was upset & I am sure my tone exhibited that, but I did not expect the unprofessionalism I received from Ms. Ebony, in her position & as someone who was supposed to call me to help & attempt to defuse the situation. I had to go to yet another shop to have the brakes aligned, & he offered to do it at NO Charge for all the trauma my daughter has already gone through thus far.

Ivan,0.4,"Mavis corporate, NY store and GA store

This is review regarding Mavis as a whole not one store but multiple stores as well as corporate office.
Last year in April, I took 2 vehicles to Mavis on Rt.55 in La Grange NY, store (or wappinger falls). On both cars I replaced the tires (full set), did alignment, brakes. On one vehicle I did some extra work, all together I spent close to $6k in this store. A year later and 5k miles on one car inside of the front tires completely wore, no threads left. At this time I already moved to Georgia so I took my car to Mavis in this store.
They checked my car and found that alignment is done as I am driving in a race not on the road, reason why tires wore. As they could not find any records of work previously done in any store at Mavis, I showed the guy my receipt from email. However he could not do anything as my work was not in the system, but he gave me good discount. While there, I called a store in NY, and the person that answer stated that everyone was fired last year before Xmas for doing shady things and that he can not do anything so I had to call corporate.
Now this is where it gets interesting as, first person I spoke to at corporate acknowledged Mavis fault, stated I need to receive full refund and forwarded my case to area manager of the store in NY. Area manager acknowledged the fault as well, but due to wheel alignment being done more than 90days ago, warranty on everything is voided and offered me $50 discount on future services. As I was not happy with solutions (5000 miles on brand new tires) I called corporate again and they stated they will see what they can do. I told them not to bother me anymore unless they are willing to give me full refund for their mistake and i received no other calls.
This is after I had to send invoice I had to everyone as they did not have a copy or it was filled completely different than what I had. Remember as well, I did $6k work with them before my move as well as $500 work for new front tires and alignment that they messed up.
Store in GA in Alpharetta near Johns Creek is excellent and they get 5 stars, corporate and store in NY zero (hence 2 star rating).
Due to inability of Mavis to correct their mistakes (especially when acknowledged them) I will not do work with them anymore. I know what I do, but my wife does not know what is going on with the car until already bad.",US,1,2022-06-03T22:13:50Z,Mavis Discount Tire

MICHAEL REID,0.8,"Tire stem core blow out...

Unfortunately, 6 months into a new set of tires and I had a slow leak in one of the four. I went to wawa to air up the tire and the valve stem core blew out...this is on a new set of tires mind you. As luck would have it, I bought them from a Mavis and there happened to be a Mavis less than 2 miles from the wawa. I put a cap on the stem to prevent additional leaking and drove to Mavis. They were not opened yet and one of the crew explained that they have appointments that may take priority over my issue. I totally get it. They have a business that is organized around appointments and I came rolling in with a relatively simple emergency. Well, as luck would have it, not all of the scheduled appointments arrived on time, so they were able to squeeze me in. The stem had broken and needed to be replaced so it took a bit longer than anticipated, but they had me on the road within 45 minutes and were fair about the expense...really just charged for labor. I always liked Mavis and this was really just a tire/stem manufacturer thing. They accommodated me and I can't ask for more than that. For what its worth, I think they are a solid company and I trust their service.",US,1,2022-06-03T18:09:13Z,Mavis Discount Tire

Chris handled my leaking front passenger tire very well. He understood I was on a short time considering I was on my way to work when I noticed the low tire pressure light. I was the first one in but despite two other customers coming in he made me feel like a priority and heard.

I wasn't aware plugging the tire comes with balancing (wish he mentioned that) but nonetheless, Chris was excellent. I explained I heard a clicking when I accelerated and he explained that it was coming from the head of the nail that was in my tire creating the sound (he showed me the nail that was in my tire and saw the bulky head - he was right, I didn't hear it anymore!).

I was already annoyed at the fact that my truck failed inspection for tires and had called around to different places when I called Mavis on Chrysler Ave in Rotterdam. They were really helpful and actually gave me a pretty decent deal. I got the call center however and not the store, so when I came to the store it was a bit higher than I had expected. The assistant manager, Tammy, was very friendly and very understanding and apologized for the difference. I had no choice, I needed the tires, but her friendly attitude made the process a lot less painful. They got me in and out quickly but her attitude made the difference in whether I stayed or kept looking. Thx Tammy!",US,1,2022-05-27T03:15:35Z,Mavis Discount Tire
Frank Russo,0.2,"Worst experience buying tires I've had

Worst experience buying tires I've had. People there try very hard and are polite but can't keep records straight form one day and person to the next. Told several times my tires were in. Made appointment, showed up, two of four tires in. Tried again, confirmed tires were in. Made appointment. 3 of 4 tires there. Installed tire develops slow leak. Take it in for test, told it would be several hours, they kindly confirm at the store up the street they have a 1 hour wait. I go there and 4 hours later they call and tell me I have no leak. Leak continues, go back to this store and guess what, I have a nail in the tire. Order new tire, comes in, told to come in at 6 pm to install that they were slow and I could wait. Arrive to find 1 person there, has 5 cars, has no idea if tire is there, even after looking up my account. I'm out the door and only begrudgingly will go back just because I need my new tire installed.",US,1,2022-05-27T02:55:49Z,Mavis Discount Tire

The front tires failed. Ok, tires I wanted are not in stock. Ok, let’s order tires.

Tire’s ordered. Should be in the following day.
Scheduled an appointment the day after. The tires were suppose to be there.

Showed up for appointment,tires not there. Not a problem, but where is the phone call/ communication.

Ordered tires again. Expecting to get a phone call/communication of when they would arrive.

No phone calls/ communication.

During these times. It’s difficult at times to locate tires. You have to tell people what is going on.

They used the wheel alignment charge to get to $425 an axle

Called manager within 2 hours of getting home - was very rude.
