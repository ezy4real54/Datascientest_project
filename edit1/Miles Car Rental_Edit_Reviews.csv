This is the worst car rent experience I've had in my life. Be aware that this is a third party provider; I didn't realize when booking my car.

customer,0.8,"Customer service resolved issue

Apparently if your a Florida resident you can’t use your debit card, and they don’t accept PayPal Mastercard- although the confirmation website does not say that. They accept Mastercard, Visa, Diners, etc. This booking is no good to me and it’s proving impossible to cancel. So far I’ve got the threat of keeping my deposit.
Days have now gone by without any productive follow up. I’ve received emails from the company asking for pictures of my credit card- which I e provided, and have not received follow up. Then I got an email from the company telling me they’ve been trying to contact me to discuss the matter! I’ve responded to your emails- how have you not been able to contact me?!
I have been told today that I will receive a refund without penalty. In regards to receiving regular email communication with Katerin Perez, I would be happy to raise my satisfaction rating. Although the original experience was beyond frustrating, Katerin took responsibility for my complaint and resolved it. I should have my refund in “7-15” days.

The young lady Natalia that helped me was excellent. She walked me through everything and was very pleasant to speak with.

I have been dealing with a huge problem regarding extra,unwarranted, and unauthorized charges made on my credit card by Budget Rental Car company. I made my reservation through Miles Car Rental and paid full price at the time of the rental. I had nothing but troubles from the moment we picked up the car. We were informed that they would only rent the car to us for 30 days. We paid for 50 days. After a month, finally I got some resolution from your representative that we would have no additional charges upon return of the car. I was subsequently charged $904 on my credit card after the return. In spite of multiple calls working with your team to resolve this issue, nothing there has been no refund to my credit card nor any response as to when that will occur. This entire experience has been very upsetting!",MX,3.0,2021-07-19T17:32:10Z,Miles Car Rental

My sister rented a car for me, as a gift. I was no allowed to. Pick up the rental, because my name was not on the purchasing credit card. The rental requirements are hidden in the menu, instead of a link on the page. Your company, stole 18% of the refund, due to deceptive practices. I had to call twice to get the cancelation done, because the first woman i spoke with was rude and consistently interrupted me.

The whole thing was a terrible experience and you will be getting 1 star ratings everywhere i can post it.


*update * they held my entire refund hostage until I changed my review. After 2 weeks, we came to an agreement that I would modify my review, AFTER my refund was received.

So, here's my modified review. I am. Contacting the BBB and the local news. Stay away from Miles Car Rental. They are a scam

*update number 2* No matter what they say on here, they harassed me daily and held my refund hostage. That is no way to provide customer service. That is no way, ""customer satisfaction."" They were hoping that I would give up, so they could keep the money.

I also had to threaten them with contacting the police to file harassment charges, because they continued to call and email daily.",US,3.0,2021-10-27T02:22:15Z,Miles Car Rental

Julie Chang,1.0,"Mui Bueno

Foreseeing plans to spending a short vacation in September 2021 in Las Vegas to see Ricky Martin and Enrique Iglesias at the MGM Garden Arena on Saturday the 25th, I still needed a decent price for wheels the day after in Sunday the 26th because I'm flying to San Francisco with my 2 friends to see Pitbull the next day. After a lot of searching over 6 weeks, I finally checked back with Miles car rental and secured a full size car at a great price for one day in San Francisco. I went through memberships, autoslash, and on different websites, but nobody could beat Miles Car Rental by a mile! I saved $25 over the least expensive price options on other websites! Pricing was similar to when I've used Miles Car Rental in the past when I flew to Orlando, Florida. Not only was it easy to use the website to make any kind of cancellations, to get a live person to talk to, to also drop off my car at a different location in Florida, but they had the best selection of SUVs . It being a bilingual website was unique. I'm only an English speaker, but I had excellent results so far this, and MCR is the best car rental service company online that I highly regard and will refer people to for locations in the contingent 48 states. I appreciate this company and its services. I hope that MCR will keep up the good work and always be there. I will come back to you miles car rental because you are the best. Aloha!

Shakita,0.6,"Rental policy was very misleading upon…

Rental policy was very misleading upon making reservations. It's isn't stated anywhere other than with the associate at the counter that a credit check is required upon approval. My reservations was made and paid for online which stated that at the time of pick-up the requirements needed is major credit card, valid driver's license or the option of using a major debit card with sufficient funds to cover the deposit. Which I have!. You guys took my money for the reservation. Denied me service due to a credit check which was not mentioned at the time of booking. And no there's is no customer service available to assist me with a refund. I've been on the phone for an hour + and have yet to speak with anyone. This is unethical and unacceptable. Most certainly the first and last time I use this service........
Update since my last review: miles car rental did an excellent job responding to my review. I was refunded the total dollar value of what I paid for the reservation. I do not believe this mishap was any fault of their own as a third party entity,however the rental agency themselves need to do a better job with transparent about their policy. In my own discovery Hertz, thrifty and dollar are the ones requiring a soft
credit inquiries in order to rent( which shows on your credit report by the way) Avis and budget are only requiring the original documents which I would suggest because who honestly want inquiries on their credit report every time they rent a car. Anyway hope this helps someone traveling and/or vacationing. Thanks again Miles Car Rental for you understanding and cooperation!!!!",US,2.0,2021-04-28T19:54:00Z,Miles Car Rental

NI waited until the last minute to book a rental before New Year day. Checking on line the rates were astronomical. I then came across Miles Car Rental, the rate was significantly less than the other websites. I called to confirm the site and to my surprise I actually spoke to an agent. Kissbell Parra confirmed the price, but also looked to find me a cheaper rate. In my moment of despair, Kissbell was confident and professional in finding a car for me. Also, she was very personable, I felt like I had someone on my side, not like talking to the other car rental agencies. She explained the procedure in detail. The procedure was seamless and all went according to what Kissbell described when I went to pick-up the car. Also, after picking-up the vehicle I had a question. I emailed Kissbell directly and she answered immediately. Thanks so much Kissbell, I will definitely contact you when I rent again. A1 Service!

This was an absolute rip off! I made a reservation through this 3rd party and when I called them, they said that my reservation was with another company named ""Sur Price"" When I was finally picked up, the other company said that my car price for a week rental was about $300.00 plus they required a $600.00 deposit, plus they wouldn't accept my personal full coverage insurance because my ins, company is not in their list of accepted national insurance companies. They denied being part of Miles Car Rental.They said that Miles Car Rental is just a 3rd party!!
Miles Car Rental had previously charged me $53.76 just for booking my rental with the other rip off company.
I called their Costumer Service phone number and I was told that they could not refund me my money, however, they never sent me an invoice for the rental that I had booked three weeks before.
This is a scam, I give them 1 because there's nothing lower than that. I'm going to contact the Better Business Bureau and I'll make sure I let everyone know what these con artists do.

So extremely annoyed with this company !!! Firstly, we are in AMERICA, your customer service should be answering the phone in English. I shouldn't have to ask for someone who speaks English. Secondly, When I am transferred to the ""English rep"", I am placed on hold for over an hour and then the line hangs up on me. This has happened twice already ! Imagine the frustration.... and all of this because your online system is off! I do a search for one airport and i choose a rental for that specific airport and I get an email confirmation with a completely different airport !!! So now I have to call in to your unhelpful customer service department and do that all over again ! This is the 2nd time it is happening and they can never honor their pricing in the original airport searched, so they will offer to cancel your reservation and book you another one for twice the price. Now here is the kicker.... Knowing that it takes forever, if you ever even reach an English speaker, I decided to utilize their online chat. This guy has me on hold for longer than an hour to try and simply cancel the reservation they screwed up on. I have been leaving messages and he has stopped responding. He hasn't even confirmed the cancellation. HOW DO YOU PEOPLE WORK THIS WAY ??? SO UNPROFESSIONAL!!!

I go to drop off the suv at Fort Lauderdale airport and they apparently didn't know about the $25 and said I could be charged up to $300 for a relocation fee.

This would have been a straight forward 5* review, but I have to take 1* off due to an increase in the price first shown. I'm sure lots of people would probably say I'm being picky, as the increase was less than $10, but the price did increase in just a few minutes, after I had to pause making my booking as I had a short 10 minute journey to make, so I wasn't able to finish the booking as I was driving. As said I am being picky, but why should the price increase in 10 minutes?

I will say on the plus side, the website was easy to use & I did get the car I wanted booked in the end. &They did still have a lower price than other sites & I received all the documents I need to pickup the car.

So yes I would recommend & would use again, just sort out the price changes.",GB,8.0,2018-09-30T20:23:57Z,Miles Car Rental

Honestly. I booked this reservation and will admit I should have read the rental policy better .Alamo is owned by Enterprise. So I expected the the same exceptional service I get from it's parent company It is misleading. At this stage I just want to know where my refund is. Please explain.

Verified Customer,1.0,"I'd rent again, gladly

The cost of the rental was reasonable and fair. Taxes in Las Vegas are high, so the company has no control over that.

At first, I thought the fine print too too long to read and is highly technical and had over the top requirements. (Extra, unexpected rental requirements included that you are expected to physically print a paper copy of the rental reservation, then being it to the desk at check out). I felt there were threatening expectations when you make the reservation.

Fast forward to the rental pickup.

I went to the rental place with some concern. But once I got there the experience was outstanding. Every employee was nice and the attendant they helped me almost instantly got me through the line and gave me a great deal on an upgrade.

I got a great car at a great rate very quickly with absolutely no hassle like you might expect at a good car rental place. So all of my fears were unfounded though I must say that the paperwork and the fine print are challenging.

I found out later that these things were only as a precaution and because Las Vegas has so many characters coming through town and people from other countries that they need to give the car rental place coverage in case something goes wrong. So I would now highly recommend it, just be prepared for the frightening legalese!",US,1.0,2018-10-23T18:22:04Z,Miles Car Rental

Jacl,0.2,"Worst!!

Worst!!! When I arrived at ALAMO, after standing in line for over an hour, I was told there were no cars! That it would be a minimum of one hour wait, but likely more than 5!!!
Unbelievable !!! If you don’t have a car, don’t rent it to me! Or better yet, you knew I was coming, get one!!!!
And all the manager could say is “nothing I can do”.. of course is it miami, what would you expect except the worst!!!


Update-so it’s been several months since this ordeal. Because I left an honest review, one of their representatives called me and told me they would refund my money “if” I would leave an good updated review. First, I’m entitled to a refund anyway as they couldn’t provide a car! Second they said they would only refund me if I left a good review. They basically wanted to buy or brib me for a good review..... so rather than a good review, what about an honest review. Isn’t that what people want to see when they look at reviews in the first place?!?! Or do they just want to read about rainbows and unicorns?
So an honest review of this company is to stay away. They are a shame! They are not capable either providing customer service, or even the car I had reserved. They want to strong arm a positive review, rather than earn it by providing good customer service and the very essence of what they advertise to be in business for... renting cars!!
So.... I travel every week, have ued dozen of different rental car companies, in hundred of different cities all over the world.... and yes, they are still no doubt the worst ever!!!

On the boot of Thrifty Car Rental while picking up the car, the employee told me that the insurance is not included and that I have to buy insurance to cover the car while been rented.
