Alondra Camacho,1.0,"Easy to understand, fast, and effective.

I am glad I decided to go with Aceable when it came to picking a driver's ed course. It does not overwhelm you with information and they provide visual guides such as videos and graphs to understand the material better. Overall, a very good course so far!",US,1,2022-08-15T21:23:15Z,Aceable
Ryder,0.8,"Overall a great program

Overall a great program. A lot better than having to go to in person drivers Ed. My only critique is that I wish the progress bar showed what percentage of the course you’ve completed instead of just showing a line. Overall great course!",US,1,2022-08-15T17:23:09Z,Aceable
Sara,1.0,"Aceable

Aceable is the best. I truly liked how everything was broken down and was easy to understand. Also how they had videos explaining the topics so it’s not just about reading through it. And how it explains what we have to bring or just br ready for what we are to expect at the DMV.",US,1,2022-08-14T22:00:37Z,Aceable

Would not refund or transfer class. Once I paid, they just took my money. Will never use.

Edit: I called back to see if I could talk to a different agent. I ended up talking to two different agents, for a total of 3 agents.

Aceable Driving Course is a less boring way of learning how to drive. As a high school student, I already have to read extremely long passages, Aceable, allows me to take each chapter with the most important details, and separates the entire chapter by numerous pages, making it look more appealing and more likely for me to continue consistently with the course.

Taylor,1.0,"Amazing Program!

I loved Aceable because I heard from a lot of my friends (that used different programs) that they would have a certain amount of time they had to fill to be able to finish a certain lesson. What I loved about Aceable is that you could totally take it at your own pace. I love to be read to aloud, it makes me retain information better, so I used the read aloud feature at the beginning and as I got through the program more, I decided to read silently because it was quicker. I just love the flexibility that comes with Aceable! I would totally recommend.",US,1,2022-08-07T03:38:14Z,Aceable

Mohammad,1.0,"be more responsible

based on my understanding, this course was orchestrated to convey knowledge, responsibility and commitment for those people who are entitled to enjoy the privilege of driving on the toad. it is not something just to learn and pass the exam instead it is an introduction to learn every day and translated those knowledge into action to prevent fatal accidents and make the road, we share with others, more safer.
thank you for your responsible and smart method of education.

Aceable has been incredible! It is truly an amazing program. Instead of hours of extremely outdated videos with an old man talking, aceable takes an engaging and fun view of learning to drive. The course is full of humor to keep the reader engaged, but it's not to the point that you can't focus on learning or it feels like you are scrolling a memepage on social media.

Dawson,1.0,"Aceable is the best!

Ace felt like my best friend and made learning about driving super easy! I have older siblings that had to take in person drivers Ed courses and it made me scared to grow up and go through the process of getting my license, however by the time I turned 16 Aceable was operational and the perfect option for me! It was super easy to use, perfectly fit my time frame, and kept me entertained, as well as, ready to learn all about driving safety with the exciting lessons and realistic scenarios and videos. Ace also felt like a genuine guy when he said that he was only looking out for my best interest when telling me to be safe out on the road, and I think that will stick with me and prove that the bond we had will be way more effective at keeping me safe on the road than any boring drivers Ed classroom experience would have been.

David,0.6,"Eventually figured out our issue

Revised Review:
I connected with their team that monitors reviews and they were able to help me. They set it up so my son could take the test again without paying more, and with the whole hour, he passed. This was the desired solution as I didn't want a refund, I just wanted him to be able to take the test fairly with the full time. They said that the issue with the shortened clock was on the state DMV's side (which, having been to the DMV a few times, I believe), but since we were paying Aceable, it's nice that they helped straighten it out. I wish that the original customer service representative would have done the same thing.

I'm moving my review from 1 star to 3 stars. In summary, there were some technical difficulties that the original CSR couldn't or wouldn't fix, but after posting my original review, the second CSR who reached out was able to resolve. I'm on the fence whether I'll use them again for my next son.

Original Review:
My son took the drivers ed course, and it was fine. He took the test and didn't pass the first time (not a huge surprise, given how fast he went through some lessons). After him really studying, I paid for a second test (students are allowed three attempts, requiring an additional $25 each for the 2nd and 3rd), but when it started, the hour timer was already more than half over. He hurried through and tried to take it, but with literally only twenty minutes, he rushed and didn't pass. We immediately contacted Aceable (25 minutes after the test started) to inform them and asked for a chance to retake the exam with a full hour, but they said there was nothing they could do - no refund and no retake. Would he have passed if he had the full hour? Maybe, but we'll never know because he was only given 20 minutes. I asked them to check their logs or metadata to check on the problem, but they wouldn't or couldn't. I understand needing to work through technology bugs, but the customer service failure is less excusable.",US,2,2022-08-13T18:24:45Z,Aceable

Lo único necesario es que la voz no sale en español. Es algo muy necesario cuando hispanos hablantes no hablan ingles.
Es muy necesario si las lecciones son seleccionadas para leer en español sean leídas por la voz al Idioma Español de (España)y no sea leída en ingles como se escucha. Esto es un error de sincronización que puede crear confusion a la hora que los estudiantes del curso que solo hablan idioma Español estén recibiendo el contenido.
El Español de España es más generalizado y contiene un vocabulario más formal como el Inglés de Inglaterra. No deben escoger el español de países Hispanohablante porque suele traer confusión.No pueden crear la expectativa que todos los hispanos hablantes deben obligatoriamente escuchar y entender las diferentes palabras porque son de un país o otro. Por eso el Español de España es más generalizado.
Tampoco deben pretender dar las lecciones que salen seleccionadas de antemano en la aplicación al Español y salir la voz en ingles cuando no hablan el ingles y no lo entienden.
Esto no es un privilegio es un derecho de todos los que estudian en diferentes idiomas, no deben asumir como los colonizadores que todo deben obedecer al la Reyna de Inglaterra, hablar Ingles y entender ingles siendo de Puerto RicoCubano,Venezolano, Mexicano,Africanos Asiático Nativos Americanos o del Pacífico?

(English)
The only thing necessary is that the voice does not come out in Spanish. It is something very necessary when Spanish speakers do not speak English. It is very necessary if the lessons are selected to read in Spanish are read by voice to the Spanish Language of (Spain) and not read in English as heard. This is a synchronization mistake that can create confusion when Spanish-only students in the course are receiving the content.The Spanish of Spain is more generalized and contains a more formal vocabulary like the English of England. They should not choose Spanish from other another Hispanic Speakers country because it often brings confusion. They cannot create the expectation that all Spanish speakers must necessarily hear and understand the different words because they are from different countries .That is why the Spanish of Spain is more generalized. Nor should they pretend to give the lessons that are selected in advance to the Hispanic Speakers and leave the voice in English when they do not speak English and they don’t understand it.
This is not a privilege, it is a right of all those who study in different languages, they must not assume like the colonizers that everything must obey the Queen of England, speak English and understand English being Mexicans, Cubans, Venezuelans, Africans, Asians Native American or Pacific?

Aceable was a great choice for online traffic school. The site was easy to use and easy to navigate. We all know - traffic school is tortuously boring, but necessary for getting caught speeding ;(. Aceable is the best answer to serving your time for doing the crime. The school itself is entertaining and when you can't take anymore, the site automatically saves your place so you can come back to it at any time without having to search or worry. They send your certificate immediately - I even called to check since my deadline was close and I'm a paranoid sort, and the court had gotten it the same day I had finished. If - God forbid! - I ever need to go to traffic school again, Aceable is my choice! I will also recommend it to anyone I know who needs traffic school.

I was not going to comment but you asked. It was a good course for driver safety. The problems I had was the politicization of the information. Gender is not assigned at birth it is assigned at conception. Not by some misguided human not realizing this was set in motion by the Creator of all things, God! Climate change has nothing to do with being a safe driver. Once again lunacy of humans trying to set up a one world government to control every persons outcome. The fact is established by true scientist not bought mouthpieces for those wanting to take the prime land along coastlines, farmlands, waterways, homes and the liberty of a free populace. Once again under DUI and DWI you had to talk of humans as male body persons or female body persons. This is ludicrous and if you continue in the herd of lemmings believing this tripe you will surely go off the cliff. Those who seek to set up a one world government care nothing for people only acquiring everything they desire and destroying freedom. Grow up, stand up and deny the overlords or they will surely reinstate slavery for all the masses.

This is an excellent course to take for defensive driving. It's super well designed in terms of layout, progression, and content.

You can exit at literally any point and the course will remember your progress to the exact second. No doubt the best part is the writing and humor. It's hard to make a mandatory 6hr course engaging but the creators of the course did a really good job of adding in a chuckle or two per chapter.

Aceable made things fun and memorable. Something Ace would always tell us to do is to drive “Legally and Responsibly” (the Acelets know what I’m referring to). From the funny street trivia, to the life lessons, it was a blast. We learned so much more than road safety, Ace taught us how not to give into peer pressure, which can help on the road or in one’s life. He not only told us what was dangerous, he told us why and gave real life examples. Thanks to Aceable, I know I will be a safe driver on the road!

So I like the way they made it accessible to phones which was very nice but when I went to turn my phone sideways to lay down on my side the screen would automatically turn sideways while I still have my phone upright to my point of view. Another annoying thing was that when I wanted to have the screen sideways some of the pictures in the app would be so big that I could only read 1 sentence at a time and would have to be constantly scrolling just to read 1 sentence which was very annoying. And lastly there were a few sentences that didn't seem complete, and that looked like someone forgot to finish the sentence.

People didn’t need to know all the things that can make them high, (such as hairspray and glue) and they felt a little too in depth about all the physical actions they cause.

My name is Marion. I went to the DMV dept. twice to take the computer test and failed both times. I am person with sensory issues. I prefer to be in a quiet environment with no humans talking at me or around me. I received the paperwork to come home and do this on my computer.

I logged on and purchased this approved program. I have truly enjoyed the language of the program and the speed of the program. It is very informative and easy to understand. I feel very confident in my self and my ability to pass the overall test to move on to get my driver's license.

I will be recommending this program to anyone who is having difficulties with the DMV programs. Especially where ever this program is a qualified program in their state.",US,1,2022-05-25T02:45:40Z,Aceable

I want to thank all team who is behind the Aceable. You have done a really great job. Whole presented information as rules , laws, rights are adapted to a person with an average intelligence. There is no bored raw text that mostly is forgotten once you turn the next page.

This is by-far the most untrustworthy and rudest company I have ever put my time and money on. Even Papa Johns is more trustworthy than this company and it’s papa Johns they charge you double, but at least they’re honest with the price. They will scam you be careful. I NEVER ONCE asked for any extra purchases (read-out loud:$5 & road-side assistance:>$5). I ALWAYS MAKE sure I never chose agree on anything unless I read the agreements and yet I’m still being scammed I feel helpless. I’m still paying for something, they change it every time, that costs >$5. My father and I (because they’ve already took all of my money from my MINIMUM wage job), has been paying for this $5 charge over three years now. He’s contacted them many times, told us they took it off three times. Today, May 17, we received yet another charge from aceables for who knows what reason they’re saying again. They use the road-side assistance excuse to take your money without you knowing unless you constantly keep your bank account.

Carlos Sandoval,1.0,"My opinion on all the courses (content/material)

This driving course is very educational and for new drivers and it's easy to learn all the information as well. The reason I found it easier to learn with Acebale is because the course comes with audio (which is optional for an extra $5). But even without the audio the course provides videos, humor, recaps of content, and questions through the course to make sure you are paying attention and soaking the information properly. When I get the questions being provided correct, I know that I am learning. At the end of each chapter in the sections. You are given a 10 question quiz, which test you on the material in the chapter. If you do well and answer everything properly its very exciting and it feels like you are a step closer to your license. I would recommend this course to anyone trying to get their license.",US,1,2022-04-16T00:54:30Z,Aceable

this course sucks massive dooky.

Very easy to read format of Safe driving course. I sit & studied 8 hours long !!! I passed the all questions. No final Exam. Then get my certificate in 1 minute ( cost $10 ) deliver to my Email. Other website charge $29 !!! Then I submitted to the traffic court same day I appeared. The judge gave me dismiss ticket paper ( if not I get fine of $250) and the judge still request you take the course and resubmit within 90 days !!! Luckily I went ahead to do some research , and took the course before going to the court. The court fee is $144 is unavoidable. So finally I save $250 & dismiss my ticket in my driving record.

Rachael,1.0,"Experienced British driver learning Texan driving........!!!

At first I thought 6 hours of sitting in front of a computer would be dull but this was a really enjoyable and informative way of learning to drive even though I have been driving for 30 years in the UK! I even used the App which was really easy to use. The course can be done on a computer and/or app which made it easier to complete. The course content was very thought provoking too especially during the sections regarding texting and how drivers can easily be distracted. Having recently moved over here and witnessed first hand how some people drive (or at least think they can drive sensibly) I am now more of a defensive driver than I was back home. I am in shock when I see how drivers sometimes don't indicate, swerve in and out of lanes, TEXTING, putting make up on and just generally having no regard for others. But getting back to the course, the whole process from registering and having step by step guidance was easy to follow and explained clearly. It wasn't boring to follow and the help from Ace the Robot was great. I found it very interesting and didn't fall asleep!! Highly recommended!!",US,2,2022-02-08T04:24:18Z,Aceable

Mohamadreza,1.0,"it was pretty nice

it was pretty nice , detailed , and completely usefull . the notice to details was its special privilege.
but I think the final test questions sometimes were confusing , for example :
there was a test that , how much maximum alcohol may be find in minor blood , and the I reply .02 , in another question
how much alcohol for miner accepted by police , the reply : zero tolerance ,
both of them was about minors
please check them

Cons:

3rd: It took more then 10 hours for me with minimal brakes.

It was a good program. The only issue I had is having to hold onto the mouse for five long hours.

Tapping on the arrow key or space bar throughout the program to advance to the next page would be better, and keep my shoulder from getting sore.

This company has great reviews and I experienced this first hand recently. Currently (1-1-22) Aceable only serves Miami-Dade county in Florida ... they are NOT ""state-wide"".

Amazing, easy to learn, they make sure you’re paying attention by asking questions about the topic you’re learning about. They have so many practice quizzes to make sure you’re prepared for most of your subjects. Also they have everything in audio form and text form so if you are the type of person that has a hard time focusing or learning by reading every single word of text Ace will read it out for you. Simple to learn and they try their best to never make it boring by giving Ace a bunch of random jokes and they have pictures of stuff you don’t know about as they’re teaching you like: what does an intersection look like? What does a t-section look like? They even show videos, the most interesting one to me was how to fix your vehicle. Or how to deal with certain situations such as when your vehicle gets stuck in mud, you have to deflate your tires a little to get out. Also love how Ace talks about the importance of not texting and driving, they had a whole section about it and so many videos and questions.",US,1,2022-01-28T16:18:04Z,Aceable

The course covered necessary and informative information thoroughly. Text, verbal, and videos were straight to the point. Incidental humor helped break the serious parts.

I am impressed by the technology and animation in the videos. You definitely made a usual boring course into a valuable tool for defensive driving.

I think that Aceable is one of the best ways to learn for teenagers learning how to drive. It gives plenty of information on everything I’ve needed, and even excess information which is always good.The only problem that I can see is maybe some of the deliveries of this information is a little childish. This is not a big issue, but I believe this course could be perfected with and update for today’s teens.",US,1,2022-01-11T13:11:32Z,Aceable

Aceable is one of those apps you dream of: easy to use, no stress, efficient, and understandable.

Nearly everything you need for your education [ on driving ] is in the app.
I also love how the Aceable team keeps the subject light, and bore - free.
This course/app is so informative it should be THE standard for all DE purposes.
I do not regret one cent I paid for the course.

Aceable was so helpful in getting my permit and license. 1st of all it went over the information really well and it helped me understand how scary driving can be if you don't know what you are doing. But if you are an acelet, you already know you are gonna be a great driver. Second of all, I loved how it told you what you need when you are going to get your permit/license. It makes it so much easier to get all of the paper. Lastly, I thought the street trivia videos were hilarious.",US,1,2021-12-08T04:19:46Z,Aceable

Brady,1.0,"More than just a driver’s Ed course

At first this course looked daunting with 12 levels, but once I started to actually do it, it went by fast. Ace was a good teacher and companion along the way. This course was easy for the right reasons. They say, “The best teachers just remind you of what you already know”; most of this was common sense and pretty self explanatory but it also gives you more than you payed for: it gives you information on insurance, buying a car, water safety, what to do in an emergency, etc. Overall I think I am a better, more informed driver than had I done an alternative drivers Ed course. Because of this course I can now drive legally and responsible in the state of Texas ;)

As I wrote before, the course was long, but fine - I aced all the assessment tests, got 2 wrong on the final - one because I skipped over the ""NOT"" phrase, and one because I think you have made an error on the text on the slides. It has to do with the 'most fatal accidents during what time frame. Your text is wrong on the teaching slides - someone got something jumbled up. If you had responded to my early notes on this, I would have given you a 5 star review.

Wendy W. Niles,0.8,"pretty reasonable traffic school course

Overall, this was an easy online traffic school course I took and I timed myself and it did take about 8 hours to finish including the surveys and the final test. There was some humor in the writing but I purposely did not want to sign up for an improv traffic school. It cost $19. I did learn more about stuff I probably didn't need to know but a good refresher overall. There is one discrepancy that I found on Level 7, Chapter 1 on page 8 which led me to get wrong answer on final assessment although I did pass (thus the 4 instead of 5 star review). It shows that there are most fatal collisions between 6 AM to 11:59 AM by the actual number 2158 in 2017 but strangely the wording afterwards state that the afternoon and evening are the most dangerous - implying there are more fatalities in the afternoon and evening so I was quite confused with what was the correct answer if the wording is wrong and does not coincide with the number.",US,5,2021-11-01T02:02:14Z,Aceable

Dallas User,1.0,"Best I have seen

My wife insisted I take this course to lower our insurance, and I was pleasantly surprised by the ease and flawless app technology. No glitches switching between devices, nice bite-sized bits of material, solid videos, and even a bit entertaining along the way. In Texas, the law is 5 hours with a one hour break, so I had to wait to take the last 4 question assessment to kill time, but it was not a problem.

My suggestions for the developers would be to make the security questions in a bigger font for old eyes. The course was easy to read (I chose not to pay for audio reading to me), but the pop ups to verify my identity were very small and hard for an old guy to read. I also wish there was a place to verify the drivers license I typed in on the profile page and an option that explicitly says the reason for the course is to lower insurance. The options were to Dismiss a Ticket and None of the Above which was okay, but I would have felt more confident with Insurance as a choice.

Overall, a great experience. Highly recommended.",US,3,2021-10-22T13:58:59Z,Aceable

Aceable is an amazing driving course for young tykes like myself who just want to get their licenses.

The only fault I can scrounge around for us actually the simplicity of this course, which most would say is not a con but a pro.

Paula Fregene,1.0,"Informative and Effective (with a bit of cringe)

My family and friends have been using Aceable to learn driving and have all sincerely enjoyed it. At times, dealing with Aceable was a bit repetitive and cringy. However, it is understandable that despite the cringe in the videos, there was a moral lesson in each video.

I appreciated the fact that we could take the assessment tests with automatic scoring and retake was always available to those who needed it. In addition, Aceable is a very observing, detailed, and informative platform for driving that the information provided is useful and made me (and even my parents, who have been driving for 30+) learn something we've never known before.

Yesterday, I was able to finish all lessons of Aceable and my confidence in driving has skyrocketed.

Overall, I have to agree that Aceable is 100% worth even till the very end. My parents had to purchase the class 4 times (for me and my other siblings) and we all have no regrets.

Alex,0.6,"Too Verbose, Long, and Uninformative

It can take a very long time to complete the entire course honestly. Fortunately, you can just scroll through everything and take the quizzes, relying on your own existing knowledge, Google, and training questions where Aceable provides correct answers.

Few videos in the course are still not optional and could keep slowing you down a bit.

It would be great to have more informative and less wordy text, organized in bigger chunks. Some chapters now are more than 100 pages (one sentence per page often). Considering around 10-20 chapters per level, and 9 levels, some extra jokes start to sound not funny or at least out of place.

The following areas could be covered in more depth and provide rally valuable information to new and experienced drivers:
1. Driving in the snow and other difficult weather conditions.
2. Defensive driving (more details and examples, beyond basic calls to be attentive and scan everything around).
3. Even simplest actions (stop signs, traffic lights) on more in-depth level (how to start after stop sign or traffic light if sight is blocked or obscured).",US,1,2021-10-12T19:45:36Z,Aceable

nikkii white,1.0,"Highly Recommend!

As an adult driver in quarantine, getting my Learners Permit was stressful to even think about. I did not wish to go to a class of Sophmores in High School and I also did not want to go straight into an adult class. Finding Aceable has been a lifesaver, and it teaches me everything I need to know in a very easy to understand format. Also as an adult with learning disabilities, Aceable provides videos that demonstrate the situations it describes in words. I highly recommend this to all those learning to drive, especially those taking the adult course. It only takes 6 hours!!
The only complaints I have have to do with my learning disability. It would really benefit me if I had the words read to me instead of reading myself as my dyslexia and ADHD make things very hard for me. Other than that, Aceable is very friendly and I highly recommend!!

In general the course is great,,easy and convenient to follow. Only caveat is the pricing structure, convoluted and with “strings” attached. The price as advertised includes a discount related to an unsolicited subscription based service, under the promise you can cancel anytime afterwards (of course you will forget and get charged a few times before you do). Then, there is a 10 dollar optional charge for an “instant” certificate after completion, and it’s very hard to understand if/why you would need to pay for this extra, specially in this the age of virtual communications. At the end of the day the real cost of the course/certificate is more in the order of 50 dollars, by any practical purposes (unless you take the subscription, etc. blah , blah , blah).

Patricia,0.8,"Great course, drop some jargon and maybe time.

Super streamlined, easy to navigate and definitely would recommend. The only complaint I have is that as cute as I find the Aceable mascot, because the timer is based on how much text there is on a page, I really felt like there was way too much humorous jargon from the robot that caused the timer to be longer than it should’ve. Sometimes there were just entire pages of complete jargon from the robot I would have to wait on before moving on; it was almost like being forced to take in a joke. I appreciate the humor, but not being forced into it. To branch off that, although I understand you definitely want people to consume the content and not just breeze through the course, I found the timers to be way too long. I even tried to read the slides out loud quite slowly, and even then I would always be left with another 10 seconds to go. As my family watched me do the course, they commented that the pace almost felt as if this course was designed for stupid or inept people with very slow comprehension. Personally, I think it would be okay to adjust it to people with average comprehension and reading (like 400-500WPM), and if they don’t understand something they can always stay on the slide after the timer has gone. However, when the timer is forced to be that long I feel it serves to annoy people more than it does help them.
Still, these are just very minor pickings and inconveniences. Overall, the course was excellent for what it was and I recommend anyone to take Aceable over the (excuse me) crap they offer in person. I did find myself sad to part with the robot at the end haha.",US,1,2021-08-13T23:23:00Z,Aceable

I love being able to give my children the behind the wheel instruction so that I can monitor their progress and correct their mistakes. I also enjoy being able to hear and see what they are learning as well as being able to explain and give examples of situations where the information given may apply. You will not be disappointed in purchasing this course for your soon to be driver!",US,1,2021-08-09T15:10:33Z,Aceable

I purchased another defensive driving course. After about an hour through the course I had problems. The only remedy was to restart the course from the beginning. I told that company no thank you and requested a refund. I then went to Aceable and I’m thankful I did. The course was easy to access on my phone. I got through it in a weekend working on it off and on. The material was spot on. I hope I don’t have to do this again but I’m glad Aceable was there to get me through this defensive driving course.

I only took this course because I got a speeding ticket. Aceable had some of the best ratings when I did a search online.

It took several hours (I broke it off into several sittings) for me to complete, but it was well worth it to have the speeding ticket expunged from my record.

Kaitlynn,1.0,"My Experience with Aceable

This Driver's Ed Course is great for teens. The lessons are easy to understand and they are structured to help relate to teenagers. Throughout the lessons, there are several videos with examples of how to do certain maneuvers, etc., and videos that show you real people's stories related to the lesson. As well as videos, there are questions throughout the chapters to test you on what you remembered from that chapter. After each lesson, you will be given a 10 question assessment that has questions from throughout the entire lesson.

This course was amazing. Instead of having to go to a drivers ed class, I could do it at my own pace, within my schedule, anywhere I wanted. The course also gives you step-by-step instructions on how to get your permit/driver's license and what you need to bring to the DVM for your appointments. Overall I had a great experience with Aceable.",US,1,2021-07-13T18:19:13Z,Aceable

There are several things that went into my rating.
1) Ease of using the program; my teen is constantly on the go. He was able to work at his own pace on his laptop or phone. Excellent.
2) Record keeping; I could easily access my son's progress with notations as to the percentage completed and days left to finish.
3) Alerts; the program sent texts if a significant amount of time had lapsed since the last login or if my son was fast approaching the deadline for completion.
4) Certificate was received quickly.",US,1,2021-07-13T16:42:36Z,Aceable

I am currently taking a Driver's Ed course on Aceable and the experience has been pleasant so far. Everything is simple to use and understand and progress is always saved, so I can close the Aceable tab, open the app on my phone, and continue where I left off. The character Ace is also a welcome aspect and serves to lighten the mood in what would otherwise be a mundane learning experience.

However, there were technical issues. When I signed up, I did not receive the initial email to set up my student account and couldn't log in. I tried to send a password reset email multiple times but it didn't work - it took over half an hour for the password reset email(s) to arrive. When it did and I entered a new password, the site said it wasn't working at the moment. I had to wait some more time before requesting, waiting for the email, and trying again, after which I successfully reset (set for the first time) my password and could finally log in.",US,2,2021-07-10T15:55:07Z,Aceable

After that I received more than 20 emails saying that they could not send me the driver records due to wrong information. I will go then again several times to save and each time It was CORRECT INFO both my licence number and DD were correct! After that as this was not enough, I entered my password (which is also correct) in order to obtain my certificate as it was password protected. Again a TECHNICAL GLITCH... it gave me an error saying that my password was incorrect!!!!

The worst customer service imaginable! I have two teenage children and apparently their system is not advanced enough to be capable of associating the same parent email address with two children. Because of this my son is not getting vital certificates that he needs and we are going to miss our dps appointment. They don’t have another appointment FOR FIVE MONTHS! By that time my son will be an adult and the minor class I paid for will be invalid. I tried to call and was placed on hold for an hour and a half before a machine said I would be disconnected because they are closing for lunch!

I then attempted to email them about the urgent issue and their failure…. Only to get a response that says it takes them SEVEN DAYS to respond to an email. By then it will be too late and the money and time put into this course will be lost.",US,2,2021-06-29T17:51:23Z,Aceable

The course teaches road fundamentals and rules on special scenarios that may come up while on the road.

Any previous information can reviewed by going back and selecting the desired sub-chapter.

I purchased the Aceable PTDE program for my teen mostly because I couldnt find any parents who could guide me towards a PTDE program that was well recommended. Aceable was 10$ cheaper than its competitors alongside a special offer that i figured i may be able to use. After purchasing the software, I had my child try and log on with no success. We spent hours trying to reset the password and calling the toll free number on the website with no success. I left an email with their support division and I was surprised that a company offering an online product takes 5-7 days to get back to its customers. I figured that I would ask for a refund and start from scratch but Aceable had other plans for that as well. instead of refunding my money like I requested, I got an email 6 days later with a link and a temporary password. I tried the link and it works fine. My child is now using the program with no problems.

This program breaks everything you need to know about driving into easy understandable chunks, with only 12 levels. You could have your provisional license in about 6 months to a year. Did I mention this course is fun? It's really fun! Did I also mention that Aceable has been approved in almost every state in the United States of America? Yeah, that's a really big deal.

I text them and it took 2 days to get a response even though I said we were at DPS waiting to get this resolved. They couldn’t help me bc they couldn’t find him by my number. My son emailed and was told he had to take the test again. Fine. He took another hour and did that. He was given the same exact invalid certificate. DPS can’t help bc Aceable keeps sending the invalid certificate to the state. Mind you, I have taken off work to get this done each time. My son, who already has extreme anxiety, is now upset.

Hello, my name is Kassandra K. And I have completed the Aceable app Drivers Ed course. I had tried another course online and it was a horrible experience but somehow they made it seem so easy and inviting so i went for it. And oh my since the start it was so fun!! Ace the lil Robot that will be teaching you along the way is so sweet it doesn't even feel corny haha he made me tear up sometimes with the sweet funny 😂😅things he would say. He made it so easy to learn and exciting! And the 10 questions he gives you at the end of each chapter are so easy, not because it gives you the answers but because you do learn and keep the information in your head and so you're confident that you're answering correctly. I loved this app so much yall!!❤I 100% recommend Aceable Driver's Ed application for future first time drivers 😌☺!! Thank you!! ✌out.",US,1,2021-05-30T05:02:18Z,Aceable

I actually loved it! Loved how snarky it was. Very entertaining.

The robot said to just go inside and that there was no real reason to be waiting in line in your car, as opposed to waiting in line inside. It’s a just a bit ableist and it leaves out people traveling with small children, and folks who have difficulty getting in and out of their car for physical or mental health reasons.

Zane,1.0,"Quick and Easy Driver’s Ed

Aceable provides all of the materials one would need to be successful in obtaining a permit and/or license. It uses a level>chapter>page system and is easy to navigate and easy to use. During chapters there are questions related to the reading and after at the end of each level there is a 10 question assessment pertaining to the previous information from the level.
There are also extra tutorial videos in 3D VR that can be helpful for visualizing how to parallel park, merge, and more.
The bottom line here is this; it’s easy. No hassles, no frustrations, and being very user friendly. I recommend this to all of my friends. However, make sure you buy an account using the website since it has a constant discount that restarts daily.",US,1,2021-05-07T23:51:49Z,Aceable

Brendan Kimbrough,0.4,"Good drivers Education course BUT

Good drivers Education course BUT, if you are a parent and your child signs up for a course they also sign up for a trial monthly roadside assistance program that you have to opt-out of AFTER your child has signed up for the course. But its not easy, because when you go to the website you can't just sign in and cancel. They make you go through several steps just to get access to your account profile. It's a sneaky way to collect at least $5/month on the backside. Beware!",US,4,2021-04-30T22:12:39Z,Aceable

Andrew,1.0,"Driver's Ed Done Right

When my girlfriend showed me Aceable I originally wasn't sure what to think about it. She had started it before I had so I would glance over as she was working on it to see what it was all about. Before long though I found myself reading each of the pages she was on as she was going through the course. I ended up getting it for myself because I never had taken a driver's ed course and when I was reading her screens I was retaining the knowledge of the pages. It was easy to use, and the ability to work on it on multiple devices and have it save your progress was truly wonderful.

The only problem I had was sometimes the timers seemed much longer than necessary. However, I read a bit quickly so I'm not sure if it's just because of my reading speed or if perhaps some timers were too long.

Overall, I definitely feel confident in my ability to take my permit test once my appointment approaches. Thanks Aceable!",US,1,2021-04-29T16:30:33Z,Aceable

As for course content, I’ve been driving 30+ years and I picked up some refresh and some new pointers that I was able to relay to the other drivers in my family.

Rayan,0.8,"Great Website, Limited Time

I liked using Aceable. I was able to look through the notes, videos, and small questions I was given throughout the course, and I was able to use it confortably at home or occasionally in the car. A problem I encountered, however, was that I am only allowed up to 2 hours of the course per day, and I wish 3 hours was the max so I could get the course done quicker and about a week earlier, while I got my course done in about 3 weeks. I did most of it during my spring break, which was a good and convenient time to use Aceable since I had much more time. Overall, I would recommend Aceable to a friend or somebody wanting to obtain their license with the required driving classes they would need if they are under 18 years of age.",US,1,2021-04-19T03:16:05Z,Aceable

Honestly I didn't want to do an online driving course at first because I thought it would be boring and harder for me to pay attention but I found Aceable and decided to try it out for a variety of reasons. For one I love the fact that you can access it at any time; I work and go to school so its hard to find time to go to another in person class; this feature lets me do my Drivers Ed whenever I have spare time. It also is very great with keeping me active and interested in learning; I find myself sometimes laughing at the side jokes they throw in. Lets not forget about the great videos and occasional breaks. This is my honest opinion; I find it hard to pay attention to most things but Aceable has done a great job with keeping me eager to learn about driving and doing it safely. Overall I think this is a wonderful App/Website/etc. and more people should use it, especially if they are like me and don't have much time in the day to sit in a classroom.

This could be helpful for both people who use nicknames and trans people.

It is informative and goes into detail about the information, saying the information in a way that those in the target age group for the class would understand and want to keep read/listening. The only thing that wasn't good was how long it was which isn't its fault for how much information that was needed to be given out. Even though it was long it did give the choice to have the online class taken online or on phone by app, which one could come back and finish, so could spread out the class and take when you can. When taking the class by listening, there are some voices that might bother some which again can't be helped and some video's that didn't fully make since like how you should and shouldn't act when getting pulled over. That part of the class didn't really make clear what you shouldn't do, but did make clear what you should do.

This is an amazing course to take. I feel very informed after completing this course.

I also loved how I could do the course any where, I did not have to wait to be driven somewhere, I could do my driver's ed in the comfort of my own home. I also liked how relatable the content was.

Honestly the greatest thing I could have done for Drivers Ed, it makes everything so much easier and it’s all self paced you don’t have to spend hours in a classroom, you can just go at your pace the whole time.

I got aceable because i wanted to take drivers ed but during the pandemic it was hard to do that at an in person driving school. One thing that I really liked about it was that it went over the information and then had a mini quiz at the end of each chapter. That made it very easy to remember the information. I did have a few doubts about whether or not it was legit, but after I was able to get my permit there was no doubt. In my opinion even without the pandemic this is the way that everyone should do drivers ed because it’s on your time and you’re comfortable with the person that is teaching you to drive.",US,1,2021-02-17T15:06:52Z,Aceable

I really liked this program, but the only reason i gave it a 3 star rating instead of a 5 is because every month since purchasing this course I was charged $5 without my knowledge by Aceable, and there was nothing telling me beforehand that I would be paying this monthly fee. I was not happy about that! And I would really appreciate it if I could get my money back",US,1,2021-02-16T23:30:12Z,Aceable

Victor,1.0,"Affordable without any compromise

Aceable Parent Taught Driver's Ed has been very good for me! The $60 minimum course fee may seem sketipcal, but it's honestly a HUGE DEAL compared to other courses with some being hundreds of dollars. Its simple slide-show like layout is very good at providing information without it being boring. The website layout if easy to navigate, and has a nice appearance. The available VR videos are pretty cool even without a headset. I know it sounds a bit strange, but I also like the Aceable robot ""explanaing"" the material, it's not boring at all compared to textbook-like instruction. Another thing, even though it's clearly staged, the street trivia team videos are pretty neat as a tiny break inside the chapters!

This is a great program if you really want your drivers license early and your planning it ahead. It teaches a lot about what to do before entering a car to knowing about the consequences about drunk driving. They even put inspirational videos on a section to really not make the choice of drunk driving. I Would recommend doing this earlier so you don’t need to do it at the last minute to the point where you just wait for the timer to pass and click next page without even reading the whole thing (like i did)",US,2,2021-01-28T20:06:03Z,Aceable

My teen finished their driving school and it was all right, but Aceable is charging me $5 a month for ""roadside assistance"" that I never asked for.

Rigoberto,1.0,"Honest Feedback

Hello, I recently finished the Instructors Taught Driver’s Ed Course and did enjoy it, though I do feel there should be one issue addressed. Aceable automatically pairs the student with an in-person driving school/ instructor. One suggestion I would like to make is to have the option for the student to choose their own school instead, rather than having to request a refund for the voucher portion in the course. Other than that, this course has been very informative and helpful in the process of earning a license. Thank you.",US,1,2021-01-06T10:14:09Z,Aceable

It wasn't too bad, but when I tried to do a refund because I decided to no longer pursue a PTDE course, as I would have rather waited until I turned 18(about 4 months when I decided to change), they refused, but they did offer to change it to adult course, so its about 50 bucks down the drain.

I really liked this course because it wasn't so textbook-y if you know what I mean. The format of it was easy on the eyes and each module wasn't dragged out. I admit, there were times where I wanted to throttle Ace for his terrible memes and monotone voice, but he's certainly more tolerable than some old guy at a traditional school. There were some chapters that seemed repetitive and some that seemed unnecessary. I understand that the chapters are made according to Texas guidelines, so it is what it is. Additionally, I'm not sure if the cost of the course is worth it for the whole experience. I will say that the price is definitely better than traditional school.

Great format. Some of the “robot” comments got tedious but good distraction overall. Add a bullet on the videos how to rewind to see a d part again.

So far I am having a great time doing this driver's ed and I am flying through because I feel like I can actually pay attention and interact with what is being said!!",US,1,2020-12-09T03:19:18Z,Aceable

Course was very educational.
I found it a little difficult navigating to get my certificate.

Richard Jones,1.0,"Old Guy who Just Moved Back to Houston

I have recently moved back to Houston and my Texas DL has lapsed so I needed to re sit. I found Aceable on line and it provided me with a quick, flexible option that avoided the pain of having to sit In a classroom for 6 hours. The cost is very reasonable and the process is very simple and easy to follow from the initial signing on through to completion and receiving your certificate once you pass. 6 hours on road signs and the rules of driving etc is always going to be tough going but this course tries to keep it as light and interesting as possible, the system enables you to stop and start as you want on any device you want. As you would expect you can not short cut the program and you are tested frequently to make sure you are paying attention as you would in a classroom environment. You are then given a final test on completion which if you are successfully provides you with a certificate enabling you to go to the next stage. I passed first time, but I have been driving for 40 plus years now so I guess I should.
All in all a good easy flexible option which avoids the pain of classrooms. Definitely recommend.",GB,13,2020-11-23T23:11:57Z,Aceable

I originally decided to use Aceable because one of my friends had recommended it to me to get my learner's license, and I'm really glad I listened to them! The program is a little more pricey than the standard options provided in my state, but it's so worth it. I really liked Aceable mainly because not only was it informative and easy to follow, but the lessons were also very engaging. The cringey memes and the effort to be ""relatable"" was laughable but it kept me paying attention. Not to mention, I appreciated the level of quality and detail provided in visuals, especially in the animated and 360 VR videos, they were extremely helpful. The resources provided outside of the lessons were great, including the DPS checklists and the tutorials on filling out required documents for getting a permit/provisional license.

Or couldn’t it be electronically sent to the in car company to expedite paperwork? Overall a good experience. My son liked having the flexibility.",US,1,2020-11-20T14:16:22Z,Aceable
Tim,0.8,"Easy, fast and Very insightful.

This course is great for both speedsters and procrastinators, theres no time limits (except for final exam) and you can just do it literally when ever you want and however much you want. Its simple and straight forward for the most part. The only small nitpick I have is that I wish there were more example videos showing you specifically how something is done. Especially in Texas where there are lots of unique things and roadways. I feel if you are a visual/example learner then you might not leave feeling completely satisfied. Other than that its probably one of the best, especially for new drivers. Combined with what you'll learn from friends, parents or just a few YouTube videos, you'll be set with this course.",US,1,2020-11-20T04:53:30Z,Aceable

Kendall,0.6,"Don't expect them to send the S number to get your permit. Takes forever. Still waiting.

My daughter took the test on Saturday and Sunday and completed it by 3pm. It is Wednesday and still no reports have been sent to the DMV office. We went there and went through the wait, picture taking, etc. only to get to the end and find out no scores sent though well past the 48 hour time they tell you. So now we have to go back whenever we finally do get the test sent in.
Update: Make sure that when your child gets the email which says -Great you've completed it and now all you need to do is go to the permit office, that you read the small print which says- if you haven't completed the knowledge exam, you'll have to do it at the office. The team at Aceable sent me an email after I screenshot her email and told us how she still had to complete another test- It's 40 questions timed and they must pass it to get the certificate and S number. She took it and two days later, after another email and request I finally got the S number to write down and go to the DMV where she was able to get her permit. So it did all work out but don't expect a quick turnaround. I changed it from 2 stars to 3 because my daughter thought she'd finished it, as did I after getting the email, but I still think Aceable needs to do a better job of clearly relaying this information on the exam.",US,1,2020-11-25T12:35:44Z,Aceable

Overall the cite and the lessons are quick and run at a steady pace. If you tend to have reading problems or trouble focusing on reading, the site thankfully has a feature to enable a voice to read to you!

The main issue I have isn't really an issue but more of a nitpick. It does try to do a #trendy or #relatable vibe by having humor clearly targeted at my age group. It does get a little jarring when hear/read a hashtag or a juvenile joke. There is a little charm in it and again it's just a nitpick from me.

Look, I've got to keep this short, but trust I'll make it sweet. This course was incomparably better when looking at alternatives.

The memes, formatting, terminology, pictures, videos, I could go on an on, but Aceable obviously sat down and checked what objectives need to be taught, and designed the best course they could with teenagers in mind. I guarantee they're still updating Aceable and looking to improve it. I highly recommend anyone who needs driving lessons to take Aceable.

In my case, I was planning on transferring to a driving school to finish up my instructor taught behind the wheel portion of the program, but once Coronavirus hit, that was soon out of the picture. Fortunately, Aceable made it an easy second option for me to transfer to the parent taught program with a $20 fee. I highly recommend choosing Aceable as your next step to earning your driver license!",US,1,2020-10-31T16:48:18Z,Aceable

Really, Ace was the driving force in my enjoyment for Aceable. It's a really cute and creative way to make learning how to drive more personal and fun. It was even able to make more boring parts of driving entertaining and easy to remember. All the points came across well, and I passed my driving test with a 98, all thanks to Aceable!!!",US,1,2020-10-28T21:54:30Z,Aceable

It's a little cheesy for kids my age, I felt a little childish t times-but it did keep it interesting, rather than just chucking info at me. I didn't feel entirely like I was drinking from a firehose either. Those street trivia team videos were funny-but only because of the hired actors. It was clear that those guys weren't actual people off the streets...the whole set up felt pretty forced. However, it was a good brain break from all the info being taught. I think it is a good thought-but the execution needs to be better. As a theatre kid, I'd say not many-if any-kids my age are gonna just believe people are that oblivious, you know? But, if the purpose was soley to entertain-then the mission was accomplished. Overall, a great program...I only to slightly fed up with the timers coming with the instructor taught plan.

God help all of the victims of motor accidents who had to suffer through a usually preventable life changing accident.

Very good information, helpful every step of the way. Would definitely recommend to a friend. Only critique is street trivia episodes, they're cheesy at best and annoying at worst. They don't offer much information and seem more like a kids TV program than a driver's education course for teens. The obviously scripted answers are unrealistic and offer no insight to how actual drivers think and act. Also the inclusion of mildly random, but still informative, things like water safety are surprising to be taught in driver's ed. Tackling real-world issues like alcohol and drug use is very much appreciated though.",US,3,2020-10-19T03:16:58Z,Aceable

She signed me up for this course because of my intensive knowledge on robots, memes and of course, Drivers Ed (I am a driver educational professor at my local prison). Not to mention the handy read along karaoke for only $5 extra! I am now able to read better and comprehend photosynthetic words! My vocabulary is evolving like a charzar in Pokemon! Im reading poems by Dr. Suess, novels by Robert frost and learning about the struggles of a Huge Historical Human who Hurt the Happy world. Now my child bride is talking to me and accepting me!

I have no complaints about the course but Aceable uses a very deceptive business practice that automatically enrolls you in a ""free"" roadside assistance program that charges an additional $5 per month. I have not been back through their checkout process but if you purchase the course, make to watch for whatever choice turns off/disables this option.

Aceable did refund the charges but I'm disgusted that it was even an issue that needed to be resolved. If they really need to offer the feature, it must be option that's disabled by default. This is a completely dishonest business practice.",US,1,2020-10-04T20:57:13Z,Aceable

Nobody wants to take a defensive driving course, but Aceable takes a fun, almost goofy and fun approach to it. Instead of those old 90's school films, Aceable has newer, more relatable and interesting videos that don't put you to sleep. It's also extremely convenient as it saves your progress automatically and allows you to take your course on your mobile device whenever you have free time. If you have to take defensive driving, take Aceable.",US,1,2020-10-01T00:52:33Z,Aceable

Very accessible and easy to use, the videos especially help make the lessons easier to understand. However, on the multiple choice questions, there are really condescending answer choices. It's almost offensive and it feels belittling. I understand the intent is to make a lighthearted joke, but I don't feel like jokes in the assesment fit very well. At the very least, it doesn't take much process of elimination to determine that isn't a choice, somewhat encouraging guessing since there is a 1/3 chance of getting the correct answer with some more POE and common sense.

Aceable is a great way to learn the laws of drivinng not only because they explain it good but they also give various examples to make sure you undestand and retain all the information that is needed. I mostly liked the questions in between because it makes sure you are actually paying attention. It feels like you are learning face to face with someone and that is so amazing because not many people like doing things online since they say they don't learn the same but with Aceable you 100% will learn better than any other place.",US,1,2020-09-22T21:33:36Z,Aceable
