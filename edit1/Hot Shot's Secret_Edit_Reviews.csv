Customer service, they hit it out of the park like always. I added gasoline extreme to the list this time and I’m sure it works.

Maybe being over critical but I knocked off a star. EDT is still the best thing going for a Diesel engine.

Matthew Weidemann,1.0,"2003 Volvo V70 T5 Automatic

2003 Volvo V70 T5 with approximately 165,000 miles and automatic transmission calling for the JWS 3309 specification and hadn't heard of anyone trying HSS products in their Volvo so I decided to give it a shot. I bought two gallons of the Blue Diamond ATF+4/Dexron III/Mercon V, which arrived packaged nicely in a cardboard box. I decided to do a dump and fill rather than a flush so I got 5.25 quarts out of the transmission drain and filled it with an equivalent amount of Blue Diamond. Shift are faster and smoother in-between gears and when putting the vehicle in DRIVE and releasing the brake the car actually wants to move whereas before I needed to motivate it with additional throttle. I will continue to use this fluid in dump and fill fashion at the next few oil changes. Thank you Hot Shot's Secret!",US,1,2022-07-05T06:09:44Z,Hot Shot's Secret

Will C Rogers,1.0,"We had some diesel fuel issues on our emergency generator

We had some diesel fuel issues on our large emergency backup generator. Fortunately, we don't need to run the generator very much, but unfortunately, the fuel was going bad because it wasn't getting turned over enough over time. I found Hot Shot's Secret online after a few minutes of searching and ordered enough to do my 2500 gallon fuel tank. Unequivocally, I can say that the Diesel Extreme brought my fuel back to life so I didn't have to replace 2500 gallons of fuel at over $5 per gallon. As an added benefit, the varnish inside the fuel rails and all the injectors was completely dissolved and fully cleaned. Performance on the generator is restored and back to OEM specifications. I was so impressed with the improvements on the generator that I ordered a quart for my F250 (which significantly improved drivability and performance of the truck) and I also ordered a quart of the Gasoline Extreme for my F150. This is a product that I highly recommend for diesel fuel. Although I haven't put the additive in my gas-powered F150 yet, I expect similar results. BTW, if you have any questions, call their office.

As always I am very pleased with my purchase! I have used nothing but hotshot products in my 17 F250 since I got it. I run the oil with the stiction eliminator at every oil change and the every day diesel treatment at every fill up. The ED diesel treatment seems to help with mileage by maybe a mile or two per gallon but when diesel is $5.50 a gallon every little bit helps. Especially frequently pulling a 15k lb trailer. I see no reason to try any other company. It also helps that their customer service is top notch ! You actually speak to a real person when you call. That is almost nonexistent in todays times.

I purchased the Hot Shot gas treatment for my 2013 Ram 1500 5.7 with 84,000 miles.
When new I averaged 15 mpg around town. In the last 5-6 years that average would be lucky to be 13, usually 12. With one treatment of Hot Shot treatment I'm getting over 15 mpg. Power is better and highway mileage is better. Hot Shot gas treatment is going in every vehicle. I've tried gas treatments before, but nothing has worked like Hot Shot gas treatment did to improve gas mileage.",US,2,2022-05-04T16:31:27Z,Hot Shot's Secret

This rating is for lack of (CS) Customer Service. I ordered a Frantz oil filtration system and didn't receive all of the parts. My call to CS at 11 a.m. promised a call back. Same day 1:30 p.m. answering machine (left message). Next day, 10:30 a.m. CS not so nice female, said Glen was busy, that she would leave a message. 3:30 p.m. no call back so I called again. Answering machine for CS so tried other ootions until I got a person. Sounded like same female. This time she said she would go back and personally give message to Glen, who had been out sick past two weeks, was only one who handled Frantz systems. Glen called back and got the parts issue corrected and mailed out the missing parts. Tried the install a few weeks later. The bolts on top of oil filter housing were not assessible so I researched and discovered I needed an adapter with access ports for the oil filter housing. I called CS and she said Glen was not in and would forward my call to Tech Support. Answering machine, left message, to this day have not received a call back. One person handling a product line without any employee cross training is ridiculous and obviously DOES NOT WORK. I found an aftermarket product that worked. Good grief.

I have used several Hot Shot products and without question or doubt they have all preformed spectacularly. I have used their products on my 2017 Mustang GT which is no longer factory.
When using FR3 not only did the engine run smoother and quicker but my oil temperature dropped by 10 percent during normal use. No product I have ever used in the past has done that
And when using the fuel additive Gasoline Extereme I found throttle response to be noticeably quicker and generally a smoother running engine. So much so that after the first bottle ran out I immediately ordered a second.
I am very content customer and would heartily recommend their products to anyone.

Jason,0.8,"Bad experience

This is an update. The dealership was lying to me about the problem. Turns out it was a bad wire. They kept telling me the additive caused the issues. The dpf and fuel pump did not need to be replaced. I really don’t know how the product worked. Will have to try again. Only reason for 4 stars is the customer service was not very good.

This is my experience and does not reflect any others experience. I ordered hot shots secret diesel extreme. I filled my fuel tanks and added the product. With in ten miles I had a check engine light within 100 miles I needed to stop and do a parked regen. I have never needed to do this. The parked regen was not successful so this threw emissions codes. I make it to the dealership to find that one of the high pressure fuel pumps had failed. These pumps were less than six months old. It was also determined that the dpf was plugged. Was this product to blame? I have been using another very well known product with no issues prior to this with no issues. I informed the company of what happened and to cancel my other order. I have yet to receive a refund. This cost me over $4000 in repairs and a week of downtime. All the company responded with was they would issue a refund. No questions about the issue showed no concern about the problem nothing. They did ask me to do this review and asked me what I wanted to do with my order. Does this make it a bad product or a bad company? That’s not for me to decide. This was just my experience with their product. Would like to add a photo of the invoice to show proof that the dpf was plugged but unable to do so.",US,1,2021-12-02T22:43:23Z,Hot Shot's Secret

After watching “Project Farm” test all the different anti-gel additives, Hot Shot’s Secret came out on top. I ran it last winter and we saw a couple storms bring -20F.

Best oil I’ve used by far. I’ve run anything from rotella to amsoil. Always “full” synthetic. Schaffer’s seemed to run really good for about 1,000-2,000 miles then started deteriorating. Green diamond 5w-40 full synthetic stays consistent from the time I put it in until it’s time for an oil change (about 5,000 miles for me). This oil combined with the amsoil bypass filter I have works far better than any of the competitors. I highly recommend to any diesel owner.

I met two of your employees at diesels on the mountain out here in Denver and they were incredibly helpful and knowledgeable on your product and similar products from the competition. They answered any and all questions I had, and believe me they weren’t basic questions. I’ve worked in the performance diesel industry for many years and I have seen additive products come and go, but you guys seem to be sticking around. Your company sponsors a lot of events and definitely got your name out there but I still wasn’t sold. It wasn’t until I saw your products on some third party YouTube videos and heard great things from other people in the diesel industry, and finally talking to your employees at the event at bandimere speedway that I decided to give your products a shot. I heard all about the testing you guys did verses the competitions products, and when you weren’t happy with the results you kept working until you had the best product out there! Everything seems great so far! Ordering is very easy, order fulfillment was timely, and having easy to apply 4 ounce bottles is great!

I've used the stiction eliminator in the pass and it was just time to switch over to the oil! Forever a customer now! I do use the everyday diesel treatment on every fill up .

Hot Shot's Secret is the best product I ever used in my all my vehicle's. I own a 2006 VW TDI with DSG transmission. Recently had the fluid and filter changed and noticed a slip in the transmission. Add TSE to the fluid and with 50 Miles noticed it went away. Now 200 plus in adding TSE and transmission seems to run smoother then when I bought the car. Car has 187,000 plus on on it.

Dana Smith,1.0,"My 2003 Dodge RAM 2500 is fairly low…

My 2003 Dodge RAM 2500 is fairly low mileage but it has never had anything done to clean fuel injectors. It seemed a little lethargic after having some routine maintenance. For having the 5.7 liter engine, it would barely get above 55 mph on a hill. So, I put just a third of the quart bottle of Hot Shot's Secret Gasoline formula into the tank, and it made a hell of difference right away. By the time the tank of gasoline was needing to be refilled, the truck performed like new again. I filled the tank and will be adding another third of a bottle of Hot Shot's Secret just to see if performance can get any better.
I had to order the Hot Shot on line because none of the auto parts stores carry it here in Santa Fe, New Mexico. It has proven to be better than any other additive I have tried (Lucas Oil's Gas Treatment for example (two bottles and no real results.)",US,1,2021-05-25T16:39:55Z,Hot Shot's Secret

James Cheyne,0.6,"Purchased the small engine special for…

Purchased the small engine special for my ope which includes a 16oz bottle of Gasoline Extreme along with a 8oz bottle of FR3 Friction reducer. I treated a quart of oil (Havoline Syn Blend High Mileage) at the recommended rate of 1.5oz per quart to replace the oil in my Craftsmen snowblower & Honda walk behind mower. In preparation for summer storage, I changed the oil on my snowblower & added 10cc’s of Gas Extreme to the fuel tank in order to clean the carb while running it out of fuel. For the few minutes it ran, it did seem to be smoother than it was before the addition of the FR3. I will know how well it worked in this piece of equipment next winter.

For my walk behind, I added approximately 15cc’s to the filled tank of Rec 90 before starting the engine in order to heat the oil in preparation for removal. After running for 5 minutes, I emptied the sump of its current fill & replaced it with the above FR3 mixed Havoline with a capacity of 12 to 13.5 ounces. The GCV160 always ran smooth, but after just a few minutes it did seem to become quieter along with being smoother than before. Considering this could be a placebo affect, it will be interesting to see how the engine runs as we are in the beginning of the mowing season.

Since I had a few ounces of the FR3 & Gas Extreme left, I added the remainder of the bottle of FR3 to the 7qt sump of my ‘02 GMC Envoy with the LL8 I6. I also added 6 ozs of Gas Extreme to the fuel tank before top off. The fuel treatment does not appear to have done anything as my fuel consumption has remained steady. However, this engine is notorious for lifter tick and the very small treatment does seem to have assisted in quelling this. Of course this also may be a placebo affect due to recent warmer temps, but with a drop coming next week it will be interesting to see if there is an actual change.

The reason for 3 stars is due to the very limited time with product use, & the fact the Gas Extreme had leaked during shipment causing the product to saturate sections of the paper packing material. I am considering purchasing a quart of the stiction eliminator to replace one quart of oil at my next change to see if these are legitimate products or if they just “make you feel warm & fuzzy” with no actual benefits.",US,1,2021-04-08T17:16:58Z,Hot Shot's Secret

The customer service is amazing to start with. I’m always a little skeptical about products that say they will help with fuel economy and performance. Well I gave the everyday treatment a shot for my wife’s car. She has a 2013 Passat diesel and drives 80 miles round trip to work everyday. She was averaging around 37 mpg at each fill up. I have been using the everyday treatment for the past month and her mpg has gone up to almost 41 mpg. We have a heated garage so she never let the vehicle just sit and idle while it was cold always started it waited for about a minute and then left to work. So it has been doing as it says and helping with the mpg. I have a 2004 Cummins and use the everyday treatment as well. And it has helped out a lot with the idling issues I was having.

Hot Shot Secret antigel has been great. Never gelled up. Like a lot of other folks i first seen it on YouTube on Project Farm’s channel. What attracted me first was the extra lubricity. My truck has one of those lovely cp4 fuel pumps that like to die and take the rest of the fuel system with it so anything i can do to prolong its life i’m all for.
When it’s above freezing I use their Everyday treatment as well with every fill up. Helps with the fuel mileage and adds lubricity to the fuel. Can’t go wrong there. Also have the Hot Shot Secret Stiction Eliminator in my oil. Quiets the engine down some and did a great job cleaning the engine out. Oil stays really clean now.

Hard to believe I purchased 6 months ago but the 80% strength when diluted to 65%-70% goes s long way. Very strong ethanol odor. If the alcohol doesn’t kill off anything, the odor definitely will. (JK). A lot of essential oil needed to mask it, if you choose to use it.
I used on-line dilution calculator to get the strength i wanted. I used 100%aloe to dilute.
I used blender to mix it in. It left fine threads which I strained out through a nut-milk bag and solution was very clear.
Was a pricey purchase but considering the situation and necessity, was worth it.

Brayden Mendall,0.8,"I would purchase again but rather not order online and ship

Product took eight days to arrive (ordered on a Sunday and arrived the following Monday) which for a flammable liquid that’s restricted to ground shipping only I cannot complain about. It can loosely packaged in a box slightly larger than the bottle with the Hot Shots logo (so you can’t hide it from the wife) however some of the product had leaked from the bottle. I believe if the product was packaged tightly inside the box it could prevent this from happening, or I could’ve just had bad luck and got a bottle that slipped past quality-control with a punctured seal. Lost product was minimal and I had enough product to do the treatment I needed. I cannot speak about any performance aspect of the product due to Ford’s electric throttle control and the lag that it creates however using hot shots products in my diesel I can say their products do as they claim and my main reason for purchasing is for the lubricity and cleaning abilities.

David,1.0,"Magic In A Bottle!

I have a 2001 Grand Marquis with only 58,000 miles on it. A couple of months ago, it started jerking under light acceleration, especially between 40-50 MPH. I took it to my local mechanic and he found no codes. I was thinking transmission?, fuel filter?, spark plugs?, ignition coils?, fuel injectors dirty????? As you can see, it would have been a long, expensive process of trial and error to try and solve the problem. With not much hope, I decided to try Hot Shot's Secret in an attempt to get to the fuel injectors. I let the gas get down low enough that the fuel light came on and then headed to the gas station with this fuel additive. I poured in 8 ounces and then filled the tank up with 17 gallons of gas. I really wasn't expecting anything. Unbelievably enough, on the way home from the gas station, there was no jerking or stuttering upon light acceleration. A 25 mile ride later on in the day gave the same results. I absolutely couldn't believe it. The car runs and accelerates now with no jerking. I seriously can't believe this. Whatever this product did, which was probably work on the fuel injectors, it worked and saved me a boat load of money. Needless to say, Hot Shot's Secret will be a routine addition, at regular intervals, to the gas tank.
I can't thank you guys enough!!!!!!",US,2,2020-12-25T01:37:35Z,Hot Shot's Secret

Didn't notice a single difference. No improvement to mileage, no performance upgrade, nothing. I put this in a 2011 F150 with a 5.0 and just can't recommend this to anyone.

I get gas at the same exact gas station every time. Put this in a full tank and no difference from the tank before.



UPDATE: I was contacted by the company i purchased the product from and sent a second bottle as they're concerned I may have used the product incorrectly. I followed the instructions of the gentleman I spoke to exactly as he said and seen no change in my results after another full tank. I thank them for trying and their support staff is second to none.

Did some research for additives for both the fuel and oil side and the data showed it all. Great products and since the initial use of the Diesel Extreme and followed up with their EDT, I have noticed a slight gain in mileage and less noise from the injectors. As for the oil side, I’ve used the Stiction Eliminator and FR3 and noticed a difference. These are great products and i will tell everyone I know about them...as they work as advertised!

I placed an online order for the Diesel Duo on a Friday afternoon and received it on Monday via standard shipping. Before using the Diesel treatment, I had a question if the Everyday Diesel Treatment (EDT) could be used in conjunction with the Diesel Extreme. I contacted customer service after 5:00pm cst. The CS Rep was very kind and explained that someone in the office (which was closed for the day) would have to call me back regarding an answer. The following day, Christine from Hot Shot's Secret left me a very detailed voicemail recommending not to mix the two in conjunction.

Bottom line, I am very satisfied with Hot Shot's order expedition as well as their prompt response to my valid question. That is not the case in a lot of industries in this day and age.

A 5Star company, killer products that work, you will see an noticeable difference instantly,I’ve used their products in multiple diesel pickups, I even used it in a cat D10T2 dozer unknowingly,I had diesel in a jump tank on a job When a dozer ran out of fuel so he used 30 or 40 gallons of my fuel Little to his surprise and mine,( I forgot I had diesel extreme mixed in my jump tank) it thoroughly cleaned his injectors and fuel system within minutes ,he noticed the fuel system sputtering a bit he was thinking maybe an injector was going bad at first,we ran it a little longer after I realize what had happened,(that I had the treatment in the fuel tank)within two hours we had all the filters changed and lines flushed on the tractor and the operator said he couldn’t believe the power increase he had now with his fuel system cleaned, The rest of that day and week he was grinning from ear to ear, They now have treated more pieces of equipment with it, I can’t say enough good things about these products they are a must have in any diesel,old or new, The stiction eliminator is equally as impressive as well , they are a game changer!",US,2,2020-06-24T04:49:55Z,Hot Shot's Secret

I have purchased several Hotshot's Secret products to use in my 2012 Volkswagen TDI Turbodiesel.

Each and every product absolutely surpassed my wildest expectations and quite literally, ""resurrected"" my engine, my injectors, my turbo, and breathed new and invigorating life into my vehicle!

And, they mishandled the box so bad that I didn't need to cut any of the tape to take out the items that I purchased. In fact, I was surprised that none of the quart bottles were missing.

bought a 2015 ram 5500 tradesman day cab ,6.7 Cummins ,automatic ,custom sleeper , had 300,000 and some on truck . put a bottle in to clean it out. engine rattled and made other scary sounds but even though I kept the oil with the added additive in for 8,000 miles. the engine the entire time started every time and never missed or failed to preform well. the rattling noises and other such noises I took the whole time as my Cummins 6.7 being cleaned out.
needless to say my hunch was right. for as soon as I did a fresh oil change after using the additive the Cummins 6.7 idled with no rattle or did it make a rattling noise driving . the Cummins 6.7 idles and runs like a brand new motor.
the stuff does what it says it will do and does a great job. soot kills a Cummins 6.7 with def and egr still on it and this additive cures those problems.
I will use this stuff as directed by instructions .

Frank Lee,0.8,"Poor Packaging Leading to Damaged Content

I believe in the quality of HotShotSecret’s merchandise, but recently one of several items I ordered was damaged in shipping and I think it was the consequence of packing a much smaller, and lighter item along with a 1-gallon can, with inadequate stuffing. My ordered was on 4/10/2020, waited a long time to get the package; now that I take it out to use the first time, 5/5/2020, it’s damaged bad enough to be replaced!
I should have checked the content several days earlier, but it was a tiny crack that was hard to discover till you use the item.
Guess, under the unusual national conditions, how soon I will get the replacement to use?! Another 20 days or so?! That’s not to account for claiming is a pain! Who knows how long it will take my claim will be processed?

New Update, 5/19/2020:
Later the week before last week, or earlier last week, after getting an email from a HotShotSecret’s representative, but not having a tracking number several days later for the replacement which was supposedly “shipped out” at the beginning of that (last) week, I contacted the company to find out about when I would get the replacement; I was told that it would arrive last Saturday! It’s nowhere to be found until now!
This update is a reply to a response from a HotShotSecret’s personnel, which I received about 30 minutes ago. In the response, the person said that the incident had been “highly unusual & unacceptable”, and I was asked to inform him if I have not received the replacement! Unfortunately, this situation is again “highly unusual” that what I was told last week was inaccurate! No! I did neither receive it last Saturday, nor do I today! How sad!
Please note that there is no icon on this page for me to click “reply” to answer your message HotShotSecret’s personnel!
P.S: Again, I like the company’s products, but what I share here are the facts.",US,2,2020-05-19T18:05:21Z,Hot Shot's Secret

Having recently purchased my first diesel and while researching maintenance products. The name ""Hotshot Secrets"" kept coming up.

So I sent an email asking general questions about my little 3.0 liter. Hotshot Secrets actually called me and shared what would be the best course forward. Needless to say, I was impressed.

Fast forward to the current situation with this Corona thingy. I received an email blast from Hotshot Secrets sharing they'd ""retooled"" to begin producing hand sanitizers!

I promptly ordered 1 case of the smaller bottles and 3 quarts as refills.

These have been passed out to my older family and friends to assist them in their defense against this illness.

Thank you Hotshot Secrets for your efforts to provide us with some safety basics.

The product is exactly what we all need; but the quart bottle came without a pump dispenser, so the only way to get the product into your hand, is to take off the top and pour some into you hand.
Since no thickener was added to the product, and since it has the consistency of water you end up with either too much or too little.
Other than the lack of a pump dispense and no ""gel-like"" thickness, the product is exactly what we need.
After watching the President of the Company's video, I now understand why they did not include the thickener and I am following his (President's) advice AND I am ordering some Aloe Vera powder to act as a thickener; but the company could have included a pump dispenser, even if they had to charge more for their sanitizer.",US,1,2020-05-04T18:50:05Z,Hot Shot's Secret

I own a 2012 GM 2.4 ecotec and these engines are notorious for burning oil among other issues. I do my own oil changes and noticed how dirty my oil was with 1500 to 2000 miles on it in a year. Since these are direct injected engines, i installed a catch can and was catching stuff.I had seen this advertised on tv and did a little research and decided to try it. WOW! am i glad i did. This stuff is amazing. My engine is much quieter, has much more power and torque, even the transmission does not downshift as much looking for the lost power. Most amazing to me is the catch can now stays empty so the pcv system stays cleaner which is another problem on these engines.

I bought this product originally for my 6.0 liter Ford. 6 of my 8 injectors were out of spec and it was running terribly. Within 200 miles all injectors were within spec and the dealer was speachless when I showed them what fixed them.
I now have a 6.7 Ford with 132,000 miles. I thought I'd add a bottle to it just for good measure as it was so useful in my 6.0. After my oil change, I noticed a difference in the way my truck was running. It wasn't running poorly to begin with. But it was running extra smooth. Quieter even. Then I remembered I put a bottle in with my oil change a month prior. There must've been some varnish buildup in my truck because it really was running smoother. This stuff is no snake oil.

Chris Szczygiel,1.0,"2007 Ram 5.9 Cummins bad injector

I have a 2007 Dodge Ram 2500 with a cummins 5.9 . At 101,000 miles i started to get an intermittent “miss” when driving the truck cold until she warmed up. I brought the truck into a Diesel shop and they could not find any error codes or obvious problems with the injectors. They considered it a nuisance and suggested I wait until the problem worsens because they suspected a fouled injector. I ran a tankful of “Diesel extreme” through and then changed the oil and added 2 quarts of “Stiction Eliminator”.
I drove the truck 100 miles on the highway and waited until the next day. The problem is GONE! I have amazing throttle response, more power, and the intermittent miss is GONE. It feels like a brand new truck! She even sounds quieter at idle. I am 100% sold!
Went back to the shop and told the staff about your product and they agreed.....it clearly was stiction......the HOT SHOT secrets worked. The mechanic took my truck out for a ride and he agreed....feels like a new truck. Thanks Guys! This stuff works!!!!

Saved me about $3,000 (cost of new injectors) !

I purchased a 2005 GMC Yukon with 61,000 miles on it. It ran very good. Because I have used Hotshot's products I just thought that it would be a good thing to treat my new vehicle with a little TLC, Started with the transmission which seemed a little less than desired on some of the shifts. Within the next 10 miles or so, it was shifting as I thought it should and it improved until I can feel that it is perfect.

Then added the oil and Gas items. I have improved my mileage about 20% around town. Don't have a begging open road number to compare, but now slightly over 21 mpg. GM rating was 19-20.

Car is quicker now as well as smother in all respects.

After my discussion with him, I decided to give it a try. While I was on their website, a notice popped up about a 50% off coupon, bonus! I change oil with OSE and put the Diesel Extreme in my tanks. I drove it 600 miles, adding the Diesel Extreme to each fill up. I was amazed at the starting of a cold engine the next morning. The more I drove it, I realized it did seem to have more power. The engine had 217k on it with the original injectors when I tried the products. I have since recommended the products to several people. I believe the one caveat is once added a long nonstop drive will give you the best results. It gives the opportunity for the chemicals to do their work and the engine temp is maintained. My experience says adding and driving in stop and go traffic or starting and stopping the engine does not help clean anything up no matter what you add to the oil or fuel tank. I never talked to anyone from Hot Shot's, but there website is clear and easy to navigate with good info about their products. Again the 50% coupon was a huge bonus.",US,1,2019-05-20T20:41:22Z,Hot Shot's Secret

05 6.0 Powerstroke. My truck was missing pretty bad first thing in the mornings and after sitting all day. I did my oil change and added the stiction eliminator.

i Bought this product a few months ago used it with a shell rotella T6 and instantly noticed a power change. my 2001 7.3 was brought back to life! A week later, loss of power was ridiculous, bogging down, running choppy. i called in to customer care several times and the gentleman told me this was normal in these motor, run it about 500 miles to clear out all the bad he said. so i did, until it literally ate every seal and i noticed gallons of oil dumped in my driveway in one night. i thought it was a crack in the block but upon further inspection, it was EVERY oil seal. I have spent hundreds of dollars from the mistake of using the stiction eliminator. yall can keep your $50. i will NEVER buy Hot shot again.",US,1,2019-05-04T14:15:46Z,Hot Shot's Secret

Ran the Extreme diesel through a tank of fuel, no difference. Could be my injectors aren't dirty but so far, this stuff seems unnecessary.

I drove the truck for 2,000 miles and did an oil change. The gunk on the underside of the oil cap started to dissolve! I couldn’t believe it. It was crusted on there.

Great product, as far as I can tell. It certainly didn't hurt the engine.

The only downside I've found so far: This stuff really stings your eyes. I somehow managed to splash some in my eye at the gas station, with diesel fuel on my hands. Don't be like me.

Tried using it this winter in my Ford F-350. The product gelled up and crystallized so bad in the bottle that I could not and would not put it in my fuel tank. It was thicker than the consistency of honey.
I’ll go back to using power service thank you very much..... 🤨

And yes I did call and spoke to R&D about this. I kinda’ got the run around and lame excuse that I should not worry that once it’s in the fuel tank that it’ll be fine and do it’s job?
Tell me how you get a jar of honey in your fuel tank when it’s a zero degree Colorado winter morning?
And everyone I know stores their antigel products in their trucks. Storing at the shop inside does a lot of good when you need to fuel up.....
