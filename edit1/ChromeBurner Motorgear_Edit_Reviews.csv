Ant,1.0,"Took The Gamble And It Paid Off

I took the gamble on buying a Simpson helmet from ChromeBurner because they were nearly half the price compared to buying in Australia. I opted for the free postage option and received the helmet in just under 3 weeks. I used the Simpson sizing to choose helmet size and that was spot on.

Would I use ChromeBurner again? Simple answer is, YES.",AU,1,2022-08-14T01:39:24Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

Ordered a helmet from Chromeburner as the range in Australia is very limited. I was expecting it to take quite a while to ship to Australia. To my surprise, it came faster than estimated (recieved within a week). Love the helmet.

I have used the Netherland's based Chromeburner 3 times so far. Great value, especially for big ticket items or an order above AU$475 when postage is free.
The website is easy to use. Prices displayed in currency of country selected.
The orders are dispatched same day depending on time ordered. The shipping is reasonably quick to AU. 10 days on average, second order arrived in 7 days.
They use PostNL & AusPost. They will give you a tracking link if you email them. There is also a DHL option too, but expensive.

I was impressed by the prices for Nolan Helmets and ordered a new one. It arrived in only 4 days via FedEx int'l. Express. I was charged $26.00 for shipping. Alround a good deal.

I discovered it was too small and returned it but not without some issues. Both Fedex and UPS wanted more than $400.00 for the shipment. Even USPS charged $97.00.

ChromeBurner credited my account within 10 days.

dm,0.2,"UK orders- Import Duties- Fedex delivery speed

If you are ordering from the UK be aware of the cost of import duties. I know that chromeburner will respond to this saying that there is a note on their page stating that import duties for items shipped to uk may incur duties so I am saving them from having to go to the trouble. What I didnt realise is how much the import duties cost.

I ordered cardo edge which on their site is £499.09 and once shipped I received a note from Fedex to say that I have to pay £98.74 import duties, so the cardo cost £597.83, I then added express delivery £18.26 which takes the total to £616.09. I could have purchased the item locally for £609 had I realised how much the import duty cost.

If you are ordering from the UK make sure you factor in the import duty and check locally before you purchase from europe

I also added express delivery which Fedex say arrives in 1-3 days from europe to UK, I paid £18.26 for this and the item is now expected after 7 days. On the email from Fedex is states it is being delivered by Fedex International Economy so what the £18.26 I paid for express delivery was for I am not sure.

On a positive note Chromeburner do respond quickly to emails",GB,2,2022-07-10T12:15:54Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

Okay, so it wasn’t the easiest transaction but it could have been. I gave them 5 stars as I feel it wasn’t entirely their fault. They sent the wrong helmet first. Turned out the box had two different stickers on it. Different model and colour. They quickly sent a return slip and back it went. The shipping was super fast both ways. A few days for the credit to appear and I ordered another. 5 days from the Netherlands to Canada. Paid my HST and a small brokerage fee. No duties. I saved hundreds over buying locally. Love the new helmet. Schuberth C5. Now I have to apply to get the taxes back on the first one but they sent the website address of where to apply.

Can't recommend Chromeburner enough, if there were more stars they'd have it. order 2 helmets @ 2100 on the Fri 8th of April, by 1500 on Wed 13th of April the helmets had arrived. Bearing in mind they are in the Netherlands and I'm in the North East of Scotland.
NO VAT, NO CUSTOMS Charges on helmets from EU. £70 cheaper than UK sites.
Also contacted them via email prior to ordering to ask a couple of questions and they replied very quickly.

Well when Thur night rolled around and no update (no tracking or any email of any kind) on my order I got really nervous and decided to call them in the morning. Fri morning I called and the first call attempt dropped upon answer-oh no :-(. Second call the person found my order and to my delight stated fedEx was scheduled to deliver today!

Victor Normandeau,1.0,"Mind-bogglingly good experience....and thank you Tom!!!!

Every now and then, you have an experience that exceeds all your expectations, and that was certainly the case with my helmet purchase from ChromeBurner!! I had emailed ChromeBurner a couple of questions about a carbon helmet on their site, and had responses with a couple of hours. I was really surprised at their aggressive pricing, and ordered up a nice carbon adv helmet from their site. It was in my hands, all the way to the West Coast of Canada, in 7 days! In these CV19 days, it has come to be the norm that almost everything is delayed, or not in stock, or at a minimum, very difficult to find the gear you are after. (I've been waiting for a new plastics kit for my mx bike for over 6 months now from our local dealership!) ChromeBurner had the exact helmet, and as mentioned, the speed at which they processed my purchase and shipped to me, overseas at that, caught me by surpise. Great pricing, insane response and lightning shipping times....superb job!

And THEN...to top it off, their follow up customer service was over the top. I sent an email in to ChromeBurner because it appeared that one of the tiny screws for the helmet's peak extender wasn't in the box. It is entirely possible that I lost the screw (the tiny package it came in had a slice in the side), but I emailed, and received a super quick response from Tom, who said he'd look into the matter. In my original email, I mentioned I'd be happy to pay for the parts, even if he had to order extras from the manufacturer, but he said to leave it with him while he looked into it. He then emailed back the next day, said he'd personally gone and found a couple of extra screws in their warehouse, and was going to send them out shortly. I actually forgot about this, but to my surprise, a week later a registered envelope arrived with the tiny pkg including 2 sets of screws and washers. It may have slipped my mind, but Tom sure didn't forget.

Honestly, I am just THOROUGHLY impressed with the contact, efficiency, speed, pricing, and service levels at ChromeBurner. Consider me a customer for life! Thank you Tom....I am seriously impressed with your friendly and expert CSR skills! (Manager - please give this man a raise!!)

Hi from down under in Australia. I had done some research and read lots of reviews on chromeburner before my purchase. When spending a bit of coin online I feel it’s a bit risky, not the company itself but more the delivery system. In this case it was airfreight from the Netherlands, then land mail through Australia to my door. I had a tracking number from chromeburner that works with Australia post tracking. Australia post at the end of the day dropped ball by not scanning the tracking number so it was a complete surprise when it arrived at my door. I did contact chromeburner for advice and they are correct that it was on its way. It was well packed and arrived safely, so I am very happy with the service and product provided by Chromeburner.

I purchased the AIROH circuit matte blue, it’s a wonderful helmet, light, aerodynamic, pretty, shipping was wicked fast…

However, as I was installing the pinlock visor, the pinlock pin broke off so the wind across that pinlock hole creates a high pitched whistle that is damn distracting.

If I cover the hole with my finger though, the sound dampening of the helmet is impressive.

After a few emails with customer service, I was informed by Chrome burner motor gear they would be sending me some pinlock pins.

That was February 7, 2022. It’s now February 26, 2022.

I’ll send another email if they haven’t arrived by March 1, 2022 because of the shipping delays every company is dealing with nowadays.

No other issues with my order, and AIROH makes damn good helmets.

Si,0.4,"Customs farce

Website states 'UK customers: motorcycle helmets are exempt from VAT so there will be no import VAT on this product upon entry in the UK.'
I've been sent a demand by FedEx, the majority of which is VAT, which should not be charged on this purchase (helmet). Don't know if my dispute is with FedEx or HMRC at this stage, and don't know if Chromeburner described the goods properly on the customs form as its not been delivered yet, but it's a pain in the backside!

Update: Chromeburner are being extremely helpful in trying to resolve the issue of being charged incorrectly by FedEx. Hopefully this will be sorted when I receive a proper invoice for the incorrect charges, which Chromeburner say they are happy to query/dispute on my behalf.

Further update: Chromeburner say they cannot dispute charges without an invoice from Fedex regarding the incorrect charges. FedEx haven't given me an invoice, and each request for a copy of an invoice has fallen on deaf ears. One agent told me I won't even receive an invoice and it's the sender that will receive it. I have no idea if that's correct or not.
While Chromeburner are not entirely at fault here, I won't be bothering again as I've spent the best part of a week trying to sort this out. I'll just pay the VAT that I shouldn't have to pay and put it down to a lesson learned.",GB,8,2022-02-28T22:14:55Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

They provided everything (Nolan 100-5 helmet) I needed, efficiently and time appropriate in the current covid clime. Great price and free shipping. Excellent service will use again. Just a note about the 100-5 Nolan compared to earlier 104N: medium size of the 100-5 seems a little smaller that the 104N, and not as easy to get on or as comfortable. Also, the mechanism for deploying and retracting the sun visor is clunky and cheap, failing to retract fully automatically, compared to the Nolan N104 that I purchased from Revzilla in the US several years ago (this was a superb helmet, but damaged in an accident). Overall though, Chrome Burner provides a great service.",NZ,1,2022-01-26T00:09:08Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

Firstly I can't believe I can buy a helmet $350 cheaper sent from the Netherlands including Freight to Australia.??? I bought a Shoie GT air helmet size Large. Firstly I bought this helmet in my normal size XL however Shoie helmets are a little larger than the average helmet and was too big. large fits like a glove. Beautiful helmet so light hardly know your wearing it. Also can't believe helmet only took 2 weeks from Netherlands to Innisfail North Qld Australia.Web site very easy to use and in Australia dollars. No hidden fees or charges. Also bought a pair of Sidi rex boots. $200 cheaper than in Australia. Once again I had to order the next size up. Sidi boots are very narrow. Firstly I ordered size 44 but not wide enough my little toe was getting crushed and became very sore after a few hours riding. Ordered size 45 this time and excellent fit. Really nice Boots and very light and comfortable. My normal shoe size is a 9- 9.5 but had a wide foot. You can not go wrong with ordering from these guys every think is highly professional.

Ordered a HJC RPHA Carbon 70, as well as a Cardo Freecom 4+ bluetooth kit. Arrived in great time, well packaged, and the communication was good.
Only downsides, couldn't track the parcel once it hit Australian soil via the tracking number, and the helmet doesn't appear to have the AUS compliance sticker on it (even though the model complies in Aus).
Helmet itself is compatible with the Cardo kit, install is reasonably easy. One comment on the XL size of the HJC helmet, it fits a little tight on the cheeks for my liking, but otherwise the fit is true.

My product arrived in good condition and packaged well. Unfortunately I required a size smaller and had to return for an exchange. I must mention that customer service experience was positive as well. I am giving a 3 star rating because this company is based out of The Netherlands and I am in the US. Something I was not aware of until after I purchased my product. To return and exchange I had to pay for international shipping which was an additional $100.

Al,0.6,"BEWARE UK BUYERS

BEWARE UK BUYERS:

I'd advise UK buyers to exercise caution. The company itself is excellent, their prices are great, and the delivery is lightening fast from NL but the problem comes with returns. You not only have to pay for postage but import duty which is outrageously high and absolutely not worth it. This means that if you've ordered a wrong size, you either have to pay through the nose, or you're stuffed. Be warned.

If you're buying something that doesn't require sizing and/or you're 100% sure you won't need to return it then, yes, they're great. I may use them again in the future but I wish I'd known this before I ordered.

I've taken two stars off for this reason, even though I know its not the fault of the company. I'm sorry for that guys, but I I feel I have to accurately review the full story to warn others.",GB,4,2021-12-23T23:55:00Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

very annoyed, Purchased a crash helmet as a present whilst online xmas shopping, used google.co.uk as search clicked on top result and went to chromeburner and all goods listed are in UK Pounds so purchased helmet and 2 or 3 days later it was delivered by fedex who just needed a signature, 2 days later a fedex duty bill arrived by royal mail post wanting a WHOOPING £98:31.
SO JUST BECAUSE THE WEBSITE SAYS UK £ ALWAYS CHECK :( :( :(
AND YES I CAN BUY THE SAME CRASH HELMET CHEAPER IN THE UK.

I orderd a helmet from this company with the grantee that I did not have to pay for the import cost etc. at no fault of the company I was still chasing FedEx 1 month later to explain that I did not need to pay the charge due to it being a helmet. Unfortunately I had been forgotten about by the company I purchased the helmet from but with a little reminder they where very quick to swing into action and refund me the export cost so I could pay it just to stop FedEx sending me threatening letters with an order to pay. Again due to FedEx I never received my order and the company refused to give me a refund at first even though FedEx could not provide evidence that it was even delivered. But after approx 30 days the company’s investigation proved that it had not been delivered. I was issued a full refund alittle late but I’m happy I was issued a refund.

Instead of trying to see whats going on with the parcel, ChromeBurner refused to issue a refund for the lost package. Through the entire communication, this website demonstrated an extreme unprofessional and misleading behaviour. I definitely DO NOT recommend this shop, as you might end up loosing your money and never get your package.",GB,1,2021-11-26T09:41:27Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

While the ordering process was straightforward, there is a major issue should you need to return/exchange your purchase. At least if you live in the US.

Disappointed ! I placed an order for a Bagster luxe rider & pillion seat for my Z1000 after researching and reading many reviews posted by many fellow riders. I decided to go with ChromeBurner as their reviews regarding the product had very good feedback.
Their delivery times where awesomely quick(Australia), the finished product looks great and feels good, the underneath moulding is a bit rough will it last...time will tell. My disappointment comes from lack of Customer Service. The seat would not click or lock into place as it should. After contacting support the day of receiving the goods via email I was asked to send in multiple photos and videos, which I did .That was 27 October 2021...to date I have not heard anything from ChromeBurner.

Frederic,1.0,"Great service to Australia

This is the second time that I’ve ordered items from Chromeburner Motorgear, all the way from Australia. This time it was the Cardo Packtalk Black. I couldn’t believe when it arrived at my door barely 7 days later. I’m very happy with the service and the product. To be completely honest, the delivery fees to Australia from the Netherlands are expensive, so my purchases are restricted to the “big ticket” items, which include free delivery.
Fred G",AU,5,2021-11-04T00:52:32Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear
Ross Montague,0.6,"First time purchase

The store itself very quick at processing your order & getting it despatched. I did take the risk of purchasing it from here due to the attractive price, being £51 cheaper than the UK. A sort of trial run if you like. Reason for the 3* score is due to the delay with fedex when it arrived in the UK. I was told it would arrive at my doorstep on 01/11/21, chased them up a few times & told different reasons every time. My item has only just been released, had to pay a further £42 pound for import charges which I was warned by the store before ordering.

However I didn’t think it would take another 3 days then what I was initially told!! I’ve been informed by FedEx it should arrive tomorrow 04/11/21?? I thought this review would benefit any UK customers who are looking to buy from Chromeburner. Very good range, however being out of the EU might sting you a bit in custom charges. Saved myself £7-8 in total than buying from the cheapest price of a UK store (Sportsbikeshop).

Chromeburner have a very good range, I can’t fault/blame them. Unfortunately I probably won’t use them again. Only due to the hassle with it arriving the UK, custom charges etc. I don’t think it’s worth it for a little saving.

Martin Griffith,1.0,"I am a very pleased customer!

This was my first experience with ChromeBurner. I have to say I was skeptical at first because the site said that they had in stock the exact helmet I was looking for and at a significantly lower price than what anyone else had advertised. This helmet had been back ordered by several other vendors for a couple of months. I researched ChromeBurner on line and through a popular internet security program as well and was reassured everything was legitimate. As soon as I placed my order my credit card was blocked by my bank because it was an out of country purchase request. However I did not know this at first and ChromeBurner emailed me notification that there was a problem with my payment. The email was very professional and asked for me to approve the transaction through my bank. When I finally got everything squared away and placed my order I was informed that it would take 10 days to get to me. I was impressed since it was coming from over seas. However, I received my order in a shocking 3 days! The package was in perfect condition and I could never have been more pleased! I will be reviewing my helmet on their website and will be letting everyone in my riding group know how pleased I am with their service and professionalism.",US,1,2021-10-27T23:59:02Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

Overall experience was excellent. Incredibly fast shipping considering I live in Tennessee. Only concern I had was my AMEX card which I rarely use was hacked about 3 days after my purchase.

Just a strong coincidence since I made an international purchase and a few days later my card gets thousands of dollars of fraudulent charges.

All I can say is WOW! Ordered MC Jacket and MC Shoes and they were delivered in just a couple of days shy of 2 weeks! 2 weeks not bad you say, well here's the kicker... I'm in Perth Australia, so this box, while a little battered and bruised, arrived in just under 2 weeks and that's saying a lot for an international delivery into (or out of) Australia! I've had items purchased from Sydney and Melbourne that have taken 4 weeks! 4 weeks for an item to travel from one side of the country to the other, yet less than 2 weeks for an item to travel from the other side of the world! go figure!
as for the ordered items, brand spanking new as expected, packaging could have been a little more protective but goods arrived untouched. love love love the jacket and shoes! cannot fault this organisations online store, will definitely be using them again!
just wish I bought the Nolan B901LR headset from them had it been in stock, given an Italian store, EMlineamoto, (NOT affiliated with ChromeBurner) has taken my money and not even shipped my order as yet!

I took 6 months, a lot of email negotiations and one incorrectly sized helmet returned internationally to finally get a product that worked. Great price though. Half the local cost.

Unfortunately Schuberth had not correctly labelled their sizes (the XL61 is actually 59-62cm) so the first helmet (a L59) was too small for my 59cm head. Cost A$80 to return (Chromeburner paid half). Also stock of Schuberth products seems very low.

If the sizing information on the site was correct and Chromeburner had been a little more honest about stock availability, I would have picked the correct size, been ok waiting 6 months rather than the 1 month they said and given a 5 star review.",AU,1,2021-09-24T23:50:13Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

Excellent customer service and fast communication. When I ordered a new helmet, visor, and pin-lock insert the team contacted me directly to let me know the visor was not in stock due to a listing error on their website. They offered to order a new one from their supplier, and ship everything once it had arrived. Unfortunately their was a delay with their supplier, and I decided to cancel that part of my order so I could receive my helmet before riding season comes to a close. Throughout the entire process their customer service team was fast, honest, and courteous in their replies.

Online shopping of clothes is always a risk. So you have to pay € 10 for shipping to other coutries than the netherlands and when it doesn't fit you have to pay these costs again. There is no return label in the parcel so you have to create it by yourself. This is absolutely not a service that you can expect. Central europeen standard of good dealers ist free shipping or return.
----------
Dear Christoph (chromeburner),
thanks for your answer. Please, look at the return rules of louis.nl or amazon.nl or similar. That's a standard what a custumer expect. Forget the rules of your policy. Online shopping has to be simple. Fair shipping costs up to 6 € are ok, But fair is also a free return and a prepared return label.
I've no problem with your product. The gloves are ok. But I expected an another colour and size of the cuff. I would have send them back, but not under these conditions. So, I'll use them as summer gloves.",AT,2,2021-09-14T20:36:28Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

Ordered my Nexx x wed 2 helmet, cheapest place to order was here.
The helmet arrived with small scuffs and the pinlock visor pins were threaded so i complained, got a 10% refund and a new visor. After about a month of use only maybe 1200 miles the fastening strap began to fray and the visor was becoming scratched where it touches the peak.
Complained again and was told that either me or my dog must have chewd the strap...🙄 as for the visor, i was told i fitted it wrong, this wasnt the case as its on or off, no adjustments. They then said i must have sand or grit in it. I was then told ive already had 10% off so they didnt know what to do, then they said they could try and start a warranty claim but it was likely to take over 5 weeks. It appeared as though, helping ne out with my problem was just too much trouble so i said i will just leave it and buy a new helmet from another shop.
Nexx x wed 2= total waste of money.

Had a good buying experience. Bought a motorcycle jacket. Was a little apprehensive on purchasing clothing from a company outside of the uk. Fortunately the jacket fitted me great. Would definitely make sure you are confident that you like the item you are buying and know for sure what size you take before ordering blind from abroad. Company seems to sell to uk customers without charging local tax, which means you are only charged the inevitable uk import tax by the courier (therefore overall cost of clothing was still reasonable taking into account Brexit issues).

Shopping for riding apparel Stateside was disappointing and left me empty handed, as the selection and sizing was not available.

Hands down, Chromeburner had the best pricing, and I was impressed with the speed and thoroughness of my sizing inquiries.

Hi,
I had seen your products on eBay, but I would have had to buy the helmet and com system separate. Ordering direct was my best option. Everything went smooth until shipping. My box got held up at US customs, not that you have any control over that, but you may want to warn people that it could happen.

Super fast response from ChromeBurner! Just two hrs after initial review, I have my return credit processed! Thank you! FIVE STARS for customer service, and Product. Love my Rokker riding jeans. Great quality and fit. I'll use ChromeBurner for future riding gear.


I'm very happy with the 2nd Rokker rider jeans I recieved, but the first try, I ordered the wrong size. I returned them with the Customer Return info as instructed. (paid $113.00 in shipping!) and have not received a credit on my credit card yet. It's been 1 month now. I'll update my review to ""5 stars"" when I get my credit.

I already referred a friend who has since spent $1000 and will continue to recommend Chromeburner to whoever will listen.

The whole process was a mess from start to finish and i would highly recommend paying the extra and buy in your own country from a local dealer.",AU,1,2020-12-15T18:48:42Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

I bought the Nolan N100-5 in a color combo not available in the U.S., ChromeBurner had an unbeatable price and as it turns out the helmet was an N100-5 plus with the upgraded padding which made the price even more unbelievable. The helmet was shipped quickly and arrived undamaged even tho the box probably could have used some additional materials to keep the contents from moving around so much. The helmet itself is very comfortable and the convenience of a modular is unbeatable, a little noisy as you would expect from a modular but acceptable.

And the secound thing, i like to order from chromeburner because they are too fast delivery but the problem i can't find many selection, I mean if I see helmet I like it I can't find many colors also if I like jacket I can't find sizes.
I hope you can solution this two problem and thank you .",KW,1,2020-11-09T17:38:34Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

US Customer,1.0,"I laid my bike down a few months back

I laid my bike down a few months back. I needed to replace my full faced helmet because it smacked the pavement. I wanted a really good modular helmet but couldn't find any that I liked locally. I started looking on line and found the Scorpion EXO Tech helmet. It's a modular helmet that the chin guard slides 180° to the back of the helmet and allows you to still use the face shield kinda like a fighter helmet. It also has a built in tinted shield that comes down inside the helmet with the slide of a lever. I fell in love with this helmet and had to have it. Unfortunately I found that they are not sold in the United States and are only sold over seas. So I searched online for one and found that Chromeburner had them for about $30 less than most of the other places. I was expecting it to take several weeks to get to me. It only took 6 days. 6 DAYS come to my front door from The Netherlands. Not only that it was just as described and looked better in person than it did in the pictures and fits like a glove. The sizing chart is spot on. I couldn't be happier.

I'm taking this helmet and the bike that I have rebuilt over the last month on a 2000 mile trip to North Carolina to ride in the mountains with my cousin in a couple weeks. I'm stoked to put this thing to use.",US,1,2020-09-29T23:44:19Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

Fast delivery and excellent product. I Ordered the Shark Race R Pro helmet. The only think to note is that it didn’t have the DOT certification printed on the back like my original Race R Pro helmet does (that I bought in the states). For some people that might be important. I didn’t mind it, so I purchased it anyway.
Great helmet. You will enjoy:)

We tried finding a specific HJC Helmut here in Canada and couldn't locate on in extra small for the wife. ChromeBurner listed 1 available but, the Netherlands?

Not able to find any info on the duty but the price was over $200 less than the price here in BC.

We pulled the trigger and ordered. Very easy and figured the savings would make up for the possible duty charges.

FedEx called and we paid the taxes, no duty or shipping, via Visa and 3 days later we received the Helmut. A total of 6 days......

Really love this helmet. Light, beautifully made with top quality carbon and soft, comfortable lining. Try one before you buy, as all helmets are different. I went for a snug fit, and over time it has moulded to my head perfectly. From a looks point of view, and it’s totally subjective, I think this is the best looking modular by far. The competition look compromised, whereas the Sports modular looks like any other AGV helmet. Good luck choosing a helmet, hopefully this review will put this on your list of helmets to try!

customer,0.2,"Beware of import duties and return costs

My bad experience relates more to the cost of ordering/returning internationally. I was aware that these costs would be there, but had NO idea they’d be so high.

I ordered two jackets. Shipping to Canada was free. Import duties $126.00 CAD. One jacket fit, one did not.

I called Chromeburner and asked if I could purchase a return FedEx label from them. They said no, absolutely not. I have purchased return labels from other vendors—they get preferred rates, and can make a small profit on the label, while keeping their customers happy. So, this is an area where Chromeburner is definitely lacking. I went to FedEx... $300.00 CAD to return a $400.00 CAD jacket! I opted to use Canada Post, which brought the shipping cost down to $185.00 CAD.

So, total cost not including the actual purchases? $311.00 CAD.

Was it worth it? No. Would I ever order from Chromeburner again? No.

If you are ABSOLUTELY certain about the items you want to purchase, and think that you still might save a few bucks after the import duties, then go ahead and order. Their prices are decent, and they’ll get your gear to you quickly. But just don’t do the return thing, it’s a killer.",CA,1,2020-08-17T23:56:03Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

Marc,0.8,"Great trustworthy company

Great trustworthy company. They did everything expected of them. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is the expense with returned items. If you are in the US, the return on a pair of boots can be at least $70 using USPS. I would recommend to error on the larger size boots if you are not quite sure.
Remember you are shipping to the Netherlands when you return something.
I wear sizes 13 and 14 shoes. Ordered size 47 boots and they were way too small. I used their sizing chart, measuring my foot but it did not work out. Returned the 47's at my expense and bought 48's which are still snug but comfortable.",US,1,2020-08-07T19:47:49Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

Helmet sizes are one size smaller than the sizing chart. My head is a 23.5 inch circumference. Sizing chart indicates a Large helmet. I called the company prior to ordering and they indicated the size large would be acceptable. To be safe I ordered an XL. The helmet is really tight, but only in the cheek pads. There is no XXL available in this helmet. I have struggled through sizing by compressing the cheek pads. Otherwise it is just too tight. The helmet is really nice and lightweight. I like the look and style of the helmet. However, there is no chrome shield offered for the model I bought. Should have checked that out before I bought it. They offered to let me return it but I want to make it work. Dont like buying anything I cannot try on. Well you live and learn. The LS2 helmet is the same style and runs up to 3X. I tried on a 2X at a dealer and it fits good. If you like this style helmet, try it on first if you can find a dealer.",US,1,2020-08-02T04:48:27Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

UPDATE: WARNING!!!
Shoppers in the United States, or any other country other than The Netherlands need to be aware of the EXTREMELY HIGH COST to ship returns back to ChromeBurner. My Sidi boots (too narrow and do not fit) will cost $140 US Postal to return, or if I send them back via UPS or FedEx it’s over $300 for a pair of boots that I only paid $300 to purchase. I called ChromeBurner and they were NO help. They do not have a local state side warehouse to send returns that would help offset the crazy return shipping costs to The Netherlands. And, before I knew how crazy shipping costs were on returns I ordered a second larger pair of boots from ChromeBurner. What if they don’t fit? I will go broke. Buyer beware when purchasing items from ChromeBurner where size and fit is critical, I will NEVER purchase these types of items from them again!!!",US,1,2020-07-31T17:34:23Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

It took a few weeks to arrive with the regular mail option, but it's understandable due to covid19. The local delivery in Canada was made by Canada post.

Alonso Vidales,0.2,"I regret buying in ChromeBurner, other stores may be a bit more expensive but the customer support is way better

TL;DR: I bought a Cardo Packtalk, it doesn't work with iPhone, the buttons do clicks at random, ChromeBurner is not offering any solution and doesn't want to return the money. I bought it the 4th of June and today, the 21st of July after several emails and having to send it back, I'm still couldn't use it.

I bought the Cardo Packtalk Slim, the unit was defective, the buttons were doing false clicks and so on, I asked them to return the money since the device was nor working and I bought it less than 15 days ago, but it seems that after you use it they don't accept returns, how can you know if you want it or not without using it?
Well, I sent it to repair the past 19th of June, after more than two weeks they return the device in the same condition I sent it, it doesn't work and the buttons keep clicking at random, also, regarding to the connectivity issues the manufacturer answered:
- Seems to be typical iPhone issue; we are never able to simulate this defect with Android phones.

They didn't even have an iPhone to test it. I bought this device because it was advertised as compatible with iPhone.

I asked again for my money back because I don't really want this device it's been a nightmare to have connectivity issues and having to stop in the middle of the road to repair the phone or switch off the radio that was switching on randomly and things like that, but again, they refused.

I totally regret buying it in ChromeBurner, a situation like this would have been resolved in 15 days in Coolblue, MediaMarkt or any other serious store that also sell these devices, they return the money if the manufacturer can't fix the issue in 15 days and they also accept returns of products even if they have been used.

-- SINCE I CAN'T ANSWER TO YOUR ANSWER I'M DOING IT HERE: --

Thanks for your fast answer to this review, it's been surprisingly faster than any other answer to my emails.

""We shipped it back to the supplier and they fixed it""

Did they? did they fix it? do you still don't believe me or what? I even sent you a video showing the issue with the buttons, I also told you that they say that they didn't fix the connectivity issues because it is a ""typical iPhone issue"".

""I am sorry that you do not give us the time to solve this issue for you.""
That I didn't give you time? you can't be serious, you had more than a month, I sent it back the 19th of June today is July the 21st, is that not time enough for you?

--SECOND EDIT --
I finally got this answer from them:

- I tried to do everything for you and I was still in contact with our supplier but you placed a negative review so I do not think you appreciate my help and for us is the case closed.

Since I placed this negative review they decided to don't provide any customer service...",NL,4,2020-07-24T13:37:07Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear
Sad Face,1.0,"Shopping experience was great

Shopping experience was great. Were helpful in answering questions. Pricing was very good also. Unfortunately my helmet has an issue with it’s visor staying up. Took it apart per instructions and 2 tabs fell out (they appear broken off.) Of course for me to get warranty service Nexx website says it need to go through Chromeburner. I’m located on East coast of America, so sending it back would be costly. Even though Nexx has a North America website, it’s not active so that’s no help. Wish I could just get Nexx to replace the broken visor. Kinda stinks having this issue with a $500 helmet.",US,1,2020-07-21T03:23:03Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

Tony James,0.8,"Cost more than I had hope in the end.

I couldn't get the item quickly in Australia so I ordered it through ChromeBurner.
The price was about $100 cheaper than in Australia, so I was ok with ordering it and it taking a week to arrive. I got weird email from what I assumed was a phishing scam asking me to pay $208 in import fees and GST. The email came only about 10 hours from me placing the order, so I assumed it was a weird scam. Anyway i continued to get emails over a few more days and after investigating I found I did indeed have to pay $208 in fees. Ok, a lesson learned. The motorbike GPS arrived and I realised that it was loaded with European maps and that I had to pay an additional $195 to buy the Australian maps. I had no need for the European maps so I had in my mind that you would get to choose your map on setup and that I could swap out the Euro map. A bit naive I guess. Anyway. after spending $400 more than I'd planned, I have a great GPS which I love. Works really well and is clear in the brightest of sunlight. Does lots of great things and I'm happy to have it.",AU,1,2020-07-20T07:34:43Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

I really like Chromeburner! They have a great selection and reasonable prices! Their customer service is great! My issue is with returns. After corresponding with their people I ordered a jacket and sized up. When I received the jacket, It was too large. They advised that I could just order the correct size and return the other, and that the restocking fee would be raised. My issue is that I live in the USA. The cheapest, trackable, return shipping that I could find was $100! That will make shopping for personal items, apparel and gear, not worth the gamble. Way too expensive. Sadly, my days of shopping at Chromeburner for apparel and gear will come to an end. If there were a way to mitigate a portion of the shipping, that would be different.

The package, Cardo Packtalk Bold Duo, arrived on time as predicted, and in good condition. No signs if mishandling or tampering with.

And they work great. ChromeBurner Motorgear had the best price compared to all other international outlets. Thank You.

I would add that the Cardo Packtalk Bold is comparable with Airoh Rev19 helmet, unless modifications are done to the area forward of the ear recesses of the compressed polystyrene inning of the helmet. The recesses are for the ears and not speakers. Installing the speaker in these recesses causes issues with pressure against the earlobes and poor audio.

I used to race using Five gloves. I find them to be an excellent product. They are European sized and tend to run a little small for American hands. I looked all over the USA for a distributor that had what I was looking for in stock. Cromeburner turned up in a search and they had the model and size I was looking for in stock. With the exchange rate between Europe and the u.s. dollar they ended up being the same price even with the shipping included.

I purchased a motorcycle helmet. My order was delivered promptly (within 3 days), but the item was USED (not new)! If the item had been new and in new condition, considering the price I paid, I would have been very happy. The helmet arrived with no 'new-product' protective panels on the visor, the pin shield was installed, there was bug splatter on the visor (I have a picture of it), the internal sun visor does not function properly, and the internal helmet cheek and head padding consisted of three new pieces just thrown in the box with the helmet (I had to install the padding myself!). I thought I was ordering a NEW product, but the product I received certainly was not new.

Sean C.,1.0,"3rd purchase this season (2020)

I have purchased from ChromBurner 3 times now. Each time was a fantastic experience. My first time I bought a helmet and had it shipped to the US. (Montana to be specific)

The helmet arrived and had a built in communications system that was not working. I was seriously concerned that returning it was going to be a huge hassle. NO it sure wasn't. The communicated great all be it a bit of a lag because they are almost exactly 12 hours opposite my time. But, who's complaining... Not this guy!

I paid for shipping myself the item was received by them and they refunded my purchase price and the return shipping I paid.

I then purchased the same helmet and it arrived overnight and worked!

My 3rd purchase just arrived last week. 2 Pair of boots and some gloves. All exactly what I was expecting and delivered quickly.",US,3,2020-06-18T22:01:46Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear
James,1.0,"Amazing!

Amazing!

3rd order here, love the Chromeburner experience so far, literally burning my wheels off!

Within every order, they ship within 24 hours, actually sometimes even less, I blink and the item is here, all the way to the United States, thats fantastic!

Last order had some nice trousers, I am super happy with the item, I absolutely love the item and made my riding experience that much more enjoyable.

Why Chromeburner? Best prices, good gear, fastest shipping to the US (less than one week), astonishing customer service (they respond, and they respond very quickly in your same language), always a superb transaction from A-Z, love working with the team here.

My only observation is that they don't always have the product in the desired size, but that pretty much explains why all the gear isn't available here, because Chromeburners so good that I'm sure they are the first to sell out fast. Dont wait to purchase if you find what you need in the available selection, go for it, and do it fast!

Regardless, I got the product I needed and very fast, with support every step of the way, luckily it was the last one in that size.

Thank you Chromeburner!

A++++100Stars!

P.S. look for the promotion/discount codes tab on they're website, they aren't stingy, they have some nice freebies and/or discount codes on some nice items, you may be lucky enough and run into a nice promotion on a particular item, it doesnt hurt to check.

Ryan,1.0,"Sidi Crossfire 3 boots

I will begin this review talking about the actual product that I received and then talk about the actual customer service. I ordered a pair of Sidi Crossfire 3 boots in fluo orange, black and white. I wear a size 14 US men’s regular in almost every kind of footwear there is so I ordered the Sidi’s in Euro 49. The Sidi’s fit great even with knee braces on. I also have a pair of Gaerne SG-12 boots which are also great but it seems like I have a slightly better feel of the pegs and foot controls with the Sidi’s. Most of my riding is on trails and woods riding and the orange of the Sidi boots matches the KTM 500 fairly well. I can’t say anything negative about the Sidi boots and they have held up fine but only a couple rides on them so far.

Now for the customer service aspect. Living in the US there is no place that you can get Sidi boots anywhere close to the price that Chromeburner has them for. I was a bit worried about ordering something so expensive from out of the country, especially not knowing what size I needed exactly. Once I finally decided on the size and ordered the boots I noticed that there is a small foreign transaction fee that is added to the purchase but it isn’t very much and is still a great deal. I received notices about the boots being prepared for shipment and then sent out. And then COVID 19 hit. The only thing I could see was that my boots were sent to the carrier to be sent to the US. I emailed Chromeburner to see what they could tell me and they said that they sent the boots through their mail system and they were basically at the port waiting to be accepted by US customs so that they could be sent to the US. After about a month of waiting with nothing different I emailed Chromeburner again and was advised that there was nothing they could do because basically the package was out of their hands. By this time though Chromeburner changed their website and recommended a different shipping option for out of country orders. I completely understand that it was just bad timing for me and am glad that Chromeburner listened to what was going on and advised their customers on different options. I was very happy with my experience as they did help me out with a discount since it was taking so long to get my boots even though it was due to no fault of Chromeburner. All in all it was a great experience for a great product at a great price.",US,1,2020-06-13T19:06:50Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

I wanted to THANK YOU for the exquisite service you provided during the ordering, payment and shipping process for my new Schuberth C4 Pro helmet! It felt like Christmas when, just a few minutes ago, my door bell rang… when I opened the door, there was my helmet shipped from the Netherlands on May 15 received TODAY, May 18! It would take me longer to send a USPS priority letter/envelope from here — in North Carolina -- to my son in NYC! And the quality of the engineering and materials of this German-made, critical protective gear is superb. Unfortunately, it’s raining steadily here today and I’m not going for a test ride on my prized Indian with my new Schuberth helmet.

Michael Glenn,1.0,"Chromeburner is LEGIT!

Chromeburner is legit! I had my reservations about spending hundreds of dollars on a foreign website but I gave them a shot. I couldnt be happier. I saved $200 on a pair of Sidi boots, avoided sales tax, got free shipping and it came from Europe to my house in two businesses days via FEDEX. WHAT?!?!? Sorry but this is 2020 and I will save money when possible even if it means buying outside the country. Besides, they're Italian boots. Makes sense to buy them from a European retailer am I right? I highly recommend buying from Chromeburner as long as you know what you want and your correct size in that brand. Having to return something because of fit would be a big PITA. But go for it!

Great experience! I ordered a helmet and sunglasses for my husband. I don't do a lot of international shopping because I worry about delays and customer service. That's not the case with Chromeburner. The shipping is FAST (even during the pandemic). You may have customs hold ups but Chromeburner customer service is top notch!!!!! They will work with you, customs, FedEx, ya momma, ya daddy and anyone else that comes between you and your purchase. LOL!!

When I received an email from customs asking about a drop test for the sunglasses (yes SUNGLASSES), I was filled with dread. I sent an email to Chromeburner and Leroy jumped right in. He stayed on the email chain answering FedEx's questions and even politely asking about the origin of the request since a drop test for sunglass is uncommon given they don't advertise that the glasses are shatterproof. We got it resolved, fairly quickly, and the helmet was released.

I am grateful for the work the team did and would highly recommend using them again.",US,1,2020-05-12T16:45:13Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

Tyson,1.0,"Corvid Delays at Customs but Prompt and effective tracking.

I purchased rather expensive riding boots through ChromeBurner (CB). I am in the USA and they are in the Netherlands. Of course, Corvid starts up shortly after ordering and customs doesn't prioritize boots so there was a bit of a delay. CB posted the shipping tracking number within the hour of purchase and it was shipped on the first business day. I was able to follow it leaving the Netherlands... and then arrive in the US. Each week I could follow up with that code and, after several weeks, it finally started moving towards the correct coast. There was no delay created by CB, and as such, I can't find any fault with their methods and knew it would take a few weeks without the Corona delay. Their prices were far superior to the same boot in the USA but, for me, they also had the limited release that I liked that was never available in the USA. Really appreciate being able to find what I want and a good price. Definitely keeping them in my searches.",US,2,2020-04-28T11:32:05Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

Riding a motorcycle is more than just a way of transportation. It causes our heart rate to rise, stimulates the production of endorphins and allows us to just be in that very moment. For some it's about the adrenaline rush, for some it's a way of relaxing and escaping the rest of the world. For some, it's a way of life. But what goes for everyone: riding is fun! A question arises though: Can you really have fun if you're not safe? Can you push your limits on the track in a t-shirt?

JC,1.0,"Online International Purchase (USA) - Klim Krios - Awesome, 11/10

I ordered a helmet (Klim Krios) through Chromeburner and I am beyond happy with the purchase. I got it at an insane price. Helmet itself is awesome, best helmet I've ever owned. The helmet also came with many little extras that I have actually incorporated into my riding gear. There were probably about $40 of extras to enjoy in there. It came with a really versatile head scarf, an anti-fog pin-lock visor insert, some nice reusable earplugs that I use now, and a bunch of stickers. I'm probably missing something, but I was super happy with that.

There was a slight issue with my order that Chromeburner was more than happy to help resolve. Despite the issue not being their fault, they were extremely helpful, responsive, and kind. Chromeburner honestly has one of the most phenomenal customer service I have ever come across. They listened, offered solutions, and were extremely professional. I wish they had a store over here in the USA that I could visit. Regardless, their online customer service team is amazing, and you can purchase things online through Chromeburner with confidence because of their customer support. They really went out of their way to help me out. Next time I'm in the market for a new helmet or other piece of gear, I'll be getting it through Chromeburner.",US,1,2020-01-10T22:48:16Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

Review: Absolutely amazing service from Christy! She went above and beyond to help me find the right size of the jacket, very quickly too. Shipment took only one day after payment (on a Saturday, too). Thank you!

Update: Shipping took only about two weeks, which is amazing given the distance. The gear was a perfect fit - definitely will be shopping with Chromeburner again in the future. Thank you!",SC,2,2019-11-23T09:42:14Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

Great price on a fantastic helmet. My HJC RPHA 11 is exactly what I wanted. Not a floor demo or out of box. This helmet was factory fresh and I could not be happier!

I am very satisfied with the purchase experience I had with ChromeBurner Motogear. The helmet that I ordered was too small for me and they agreed to allow me to return the helmet with a 10 percent restocking fee. That was acceptable to me, however the shipping fee was $85 US dollars. Include the restocking fee of $30 US dollars and the overall transaction solution was not financially acceptable. It was my fault that I made a mistake with the helmet size. The length of time to receive the helmet shipment was within reason from the Netherlands.

Steve,0.8,"CB sent wrong size but refund was relatively painless, albeit slow.

I ordered a new helmet in size XL; however, CB sent me one in size M. Rather than wait for the M helmet to travel ""home"" and then for the XL helmet to travel to me in Washington State, I requested a refund which I was given a few days after CB received the M-sized helmet.

If you are wondering why I am rating CB as high as I am given that they sent me the wrong sized helmet, it's because getting a refund was relatively painless although it took a total of about 10 days.

Bottom line is that I do not think the money one can save by buying from CB is worth the wait associated with purchases and/or returns traveling that far.",US,2,2019-09-25T03:24:37Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

Jon,0.8,"Love my SHOEI NEOTECH II helmet!

The only reason I gave four stars and not five was because it took almost 2 weeks to receive my new SHOEI NEOTECH II helmet although the blame would be on US customs and UPS not necessarily Chrome Burners.

I love the new helmet it is extremely comfortable the airflow is great coming up the front of my face and over the top of my head. With the quick detach windshield taken off of my Harley-Davidson the wind from the vents could be considered too much but there are two positions for the vents and 1/2 open is great without the windshield on full open works wonderful with the windshield on.

I also ordered the Cena srl Bluetooth Communicator that fits perfectly into the helmet. If buying this helmet the communicator is a must! I am able to talk on the phone on the freeway on my way to work and the person I'm on the phone with can't even tell that I am on my motorcycle.

I couldn't have asked for a better helmet.

I was apprehensive about purchasing overseas, but there were absolutely no issues. It shipped quick. I followed it through the tracking info and was held up by Customs. Not the fault of Chromeburner. They did their part.

I was instructed to send photos of the helmet with my concerns. They honored the warranty. Their customer service is wonderful. No issues. I have a replacement helmet on the way.

Matthew,0.8,"Easy shopping process with transparent…

Easy shopping process with transparent shipping considering it was international (from EU to US). Noted that although the price for the product I purchased was lower than in the US, the discount was recovered by the company through the fact that the product I purchased was sold to me without additional components that, per my understanding, were included in the US offering. Essentially, after needing to separately purchase the missing components, I ended up paying slightly more than I would have for the product in the US (though this particular product was not offered in my size) so just a fair warning that if you're looking for purely cost-savings, make sure you know what the offering is.",US,3,2019-08-27T14:51:18Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

This was one of the best helmet by experiences I've ever had. I'm not going to lie I was a little hesitant due to the fact that it had to be shipped from overseas. My first concern was that it would take too long but let me tell you now it only took a week or so for my helmet to get here.. I had a lot of questions the chromeburner I probably sent ten e-mails back and forth through a four day. And they were really quick to get back to me none of my questions were left unanswered when I received my helmet I sent chromeburner a message letting them know I'd received my helmet and that I had a few issues with the fit. I was then told that the fit was very normal and to give it a try I did and they were right. My X Lite 803 RR the best helmet I ever purchased and I will definitely be buying another helmet from chromeburner because they've been so helpful and informative just wanted to say a big thanks to everybody over there",US,1,2019-08-12T14:20:43Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

Bought a Schubert helmet from Chromeburner last month. This was after stumbling across their website and started checking out feedback from previous customers. I choose regular shipping and it took 2+ weeks to get my helmet but that was clearly indicated when I bought it. I inquired about shipment and received prompt answer as customs took their time to process. The helmet is the same as sold here locally except for price tag. I was perfectly happy saving almost $300.

DO NOT POST MY NAME PUBLICLY.
I placed an order for a Spidi race suit, Paid for next day shipping as I needed it for an upcoming track day. It did not ship the same day, I placed my order on the 12th of April, It was received the 17th of April. I asked for a shipping refund, as I had not received my product in delivery time I paid for. When I asked for a refund of shipping, I was told I could only get a partial refund, the difference between 1 and 5 day shipping. I said that is unacceptable but they refused to work with me anymore. After I filed a dispute for the charge with my credit card company, only then did they issue me a full refund for shipping. There should not have been reason for me to reach out to my credit card company for me to get this refund. Your dreadful and inept customer service skills, have wasted my time, hopefully you can improve on this so other people don't have they're time, money and effort wasted as well.",US,1,2019-05-20T16:50:01Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

Bait and Switch on top of billing issues

I tried to buy a helmet and ship to the U.S. The billing system wouldn't work with any card except AMEX but then I received an email stating a special security code (SafeKey) wasn't entered and the charge was rejected. I was never prompted for the code. I even went through the process again looking for a place to enter the code, this time the charge was accepted even without the SafeKey code.

I then received an email stating the helmet was not in stock and they couldn't order more (brand new Shoei GT-Air II that can't be ordered in black?). They offered different color helmets at increased cost.

In the meantime, the 1st charge was pending on my account for 2 weeks and the second charge went through and billed. It took a week for Chromeburner to reverse the 2nd charge.

Your mileage may vary but I will not attempt another purchase with this company. I bought the helmet from a U.S. website and had no issues, well worth paying a little more for the peace of mind.",US,1,2019-04-30T20:58:53Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

Bruce Crisler,1.0,"Didn’t know whether to be skeptical at…

Didn’t know whether to be skeptical at first, considering the price for the helmet I ordered was so much lower than anywhere else here in the U.S. I even called CycleGear to see if they’d price match, but they just said they wouldn’t since I was ordering from outside the U.S. They said I’d have to pay duty fees and/or possibly some other additional tax that would’ve actually made my purchase more than what I’d pay if I simply purchased through them, by the time it got to me. But, I did a little research about customs requirements & receiving orders shipped internationally to my state (Texas), and decided to go out on a limb. I was very pleased that the order was trackable from the time it was processed, picked, shipped (before and after entering U.S. customs), and delivered to my door. I emailed with a couple of questions and received quick responses from ChromeBurner. The order was correct, packaged well (undamaged), and considering from whence it came, even got to me faster than was initially estimated (although I may not have even needed to, since I was on a timeline before my next ride, I did pay extra for quicker shipping though), but regardless-great experience all around. I’m not skeptical anymore and will be ordering more items from ChromeBurner Motorgear in the future. Watch out CycleGear and Revzilla, you’re misinforming and misrepresenting what ChromeBurner can do to previously loyal customers if you continue using your scare tactic to skirt around having to beat their price and value on quality products. It would appear as though ChromeBurner has a competitive advantage and will take some of your market share when other U.S. customers clue-in.",US,2,2019-04-22T17:43:56Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

customer,0.8,"USA Buyer (Texas)

As a buyer in the USA, I am amazed at the selection of moto merchandise selection in Europe. Reasonably, I expect longer shipping times and higher shipping costs. The shipping prices seem reasonable, but tracking is not consistent. As with most EU retailers, Chromeburner uses DHL to USPS for delivery. Suggest Chromeburner not require signature upon delivery, as this adds 1-3 days delay by our USPS mail rout delivery truck, here in the states. I have tested this with DHL-USPS delivery from Italy without signature delivery. Because of this, also research the product you order, as I expect a return process to be time consuming to EU, as well as expensive for a US buyer. I enjoyed the selection, prices, and the web layout.

I ordered a helmet from Chromeburner back in November using a discount code on their site. For whatever reason, the page reloaded while I was checking out and charged my card the full amount. I emailed customer service about it and they happily gave me a refund in the amount of the discount. Then, with the same order, USPS lost my helmet after it arrived in the States! Chromeburner helped in every possible way throughout the process and, when the package was officially declared lost, shipped me an identical helmet to the one I'd ordered for no additional cost. I've just received it and couldn't be happier!

Katie W.,1.0,"Go for it if in doubt!

Perfect, easy and pleasant, amazing deal! I bought three pairs of motorcycle shoes for the cost of half had I bought it elsewhere! Posted same day, and I qualified for free shipping. Took about 2 weeks over the holidays, faster than expected since I’m in the US and expected closer to 3. Well packed and nice little free gift.

I also want to note I first tried to price match with revzilla, not realizing their caveat for non US based companies, and was given a (disappointingly alarmist) response about possible custom duties and having to hire my own customs agent, complicated/expensive returns, etc, all to dissuade me from buying from there. None of this was the case and everything about the transaction was above board and as straightforward as buying from Revzilla.

All items were perfect so I can’t speak for returns but I did not plan on using those services for anything other than defects.

I think whenever I have time for the longer shipping, I will be buying from Chromeburner. :)",US,1,2019-01-15T18:40:41Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

I came across this site while looking for a pair of TCX boots. I was blown away at the price, I thought maybe a closeout. I ran into a problem with the sizing, European sizing, and because they were out of stock. I emailed customer support and someone by the name of Daria was fabulous, and explained that they would not be working with this brand any longer. I went ahead and order the next size larger, but was still worried since they were being shipped from overseas.

I again contacted Daria, and like before, immediately responded giving me an update on the shipping and etc.

Chromeburner had the right gear at the best price. However, the delivery took too long. I'd ordered on December 3rd. The package arrived at JFK airport in the States on December 10th, where it stayed with the status ""clearing customs"" until December 20th. I was panicked thinking it wouldn't arrive by Christmas, but it did, so all's well. I've ordered items from other European retailers before and never had the delivery issue I experienced this year. Don't know if it was a fluke or the class of mail used by Chromeburner when shipping.

I was pretty surprised with this company. I was looking for an expensive helmet so I had some reservations before handing over so much money to a company I didn't know. The first thing I looked for to put my mind at ease was if they accepted PayPal. They did so that was a good sign. The second thing I looked for was that out of 3 or 4 other retailers they had the lowest price. The third thing I looked for was if they had free shipping. They did after a certain amount so I was sold. I got my helmet in about a week, exactly as I had ordered and they even included a small gift. The only problem I had was initially tracking the package as they use a Dutch company to ship to the United States. After that the U.S. Postal service takes over delivery. I would still say they're better than UPS as my box came in mint condition unlike UPS. All in all I had a very good experience with this company.

Just so buyers from the U.S are aware, the helmets do not have DOT or Snell stickers which is required.

Tigershark,1.0,"Refund Received

Ordered a Shark Spartan Carbon helmet from Chromeburner. My measurement put me exactly between size small and medium. Ordered the small, not wanting it to be too big for my head. I believe the size purchased was correct due to overall correct fit, but the cheekpads were extremely painful putting pressure on my upper cheekbone area. Got a return authorization and shipped it back to Chromeburner from the US to the Netherlands. Just over one week later, got the refund to my PayPal account minus restocking fee. The total cost to me was approximately $70 for restocking and shipping which is much less than the $380 for the helmet. I feel this is a very fair refund and totally satisfied with Chromeburners excellent customer support. Thank you. I would not hesitate top give them future business and recommend them to others.",US,1,2018-10-06T15:54:19Z,ChromeBurner Motorgear

And the boots were in perfect condition, in a color and a size I couldn't find anywhere else, not even at the official Dainese store here in San Francisco. Hell, I couldn't even special order that size and color from the Dainese store.

Great company and great customer support . My own fault in US and buying is risk to return if wrong size. Bought helmet using measurement of my head to size listed , it was to small and had to order next size up.

Bought my Shark evo one from Chromeburner almost two years ago.
Version 1 of the helmet have a fabrication error causing the pinlock to rub against the helmet.
Shark is aware of the problem but can be slow to deal with.
Chromeburner offered to send me a newer version of the helmet and furthermore to cover the shipping cost for the return of my old helmet from Denmark.
I had my new helmet within 3 days.

great prices. great customer service. first time buying from a non-US based retailer so I was hesitant but ChromeBurner had the item in stock and was at a pretty good price. Only thing is the shipping could use a little help. shipped out fast, but lack of notices from the company used made things a little questionable on whether it would show up or not. A quick email to them resolved my questions and worries. so aside from the tracking info not updating properly when handing off to local US delivery service, I was really happy with the items.

I paid much less for a pair of very expensive riding pants from their website. I then bought a second pair from them on ebay. Prices on their website may be a little bit lower than their prices on ebay, but be aware that they charge a 25% restocking fee on returns. I assume this is not allowed when buying from them on ebay. Excellent tracking via a link in the order confirmation message to NL Post. Their website proves them to be entirely fluent in english, although I received an ebay auto-feedback message from them in Dutch. (?)
