Great product & fast shipping. Very easy installation all together took 2hrs from jacking vehicle up, removing wheels to putting air in the bags.

I ordered 2 trailer springs that were exact fit, and shipping within 4 days at the price of $57.00 US. I am very satisfied with the product and price, but after UPS shipping and other Import-Export charges it added up to $129.95 US. There must be a beater way of shipping between US and Canada, after all we are neighbors and suppose to have a free trade.

Ben Herstad,1.0,"The first place I will call, if I ever need springs again!

Was only one of two places I could find, that had a specific type spring I wanted. Difference is, this Michigan Truck Spring actually had the springs physically in stock, so when I called to check on the important detail, a friendly guy (Nick) answered the phone immediately, and grabbed the spring I wanted, and directly verified what I was asking. No bouncing around a foreign call center, trying to understand some call bank operator reading a script, guessing details off what may have been a stock photo of a generic spring. This Michigan place was exactly the kind of helpful service I needed. My 4 springs arrived right on time, just as described. The cardboard boxes they were packaged in didn’t survive, couple scrapes in paint on the ends because they broke outta the box during transit. But I don’t care about show quality paint on a trailer leaf spring!

That OTHER place I called: sure, couple bucks cheaper, but they had NO idea what the spring really looked like, couldn’t answer my question, they don’t really have any on a shelf, just forward the order to someone else. Who knows what I’m getting then? That’s what I hate, a online retailer that just has orders drop-shipped from some foreign supplier and doesn’t even really know what they’re selling because they never see it.


If I need springs again, I’m calling Michigan first. Thanks guys!",US,2,2022-08-01T17:16:19Z,Michigan Truck Spring

Kolby,0.2,"Terrible customer service

Finding parts these days is a big joke. I had rear shocks for my motorhome on the way from a different shop. I was having a hard time finding front shocks that were in stock. Their website said they had to so I called them to confirm that they did have two shocks in stock (I called four shops before them with no luck). Chad answered the phone I said I’m looking for front shocks for my motorhome I need to and your website says you have two in stock but I wanna make sure that is correct before I order them. I’ve been on a scavenger hunt and I’m running out of time now. He confirmed that they do have two in stock. So I just went ahead and ordered them on the phone through him he took down my information and got it processed. I asked him to email me a receipt. I thought I was out of the woods my parts were on the way and I’m leaving for my road trip in two weeks everything is gonna work out so I thought. I got home from work yesterday and the shock was there yep one shock. I asked him for two he verified they have two and he sent me one. Who orders one shock. If he would’ve in fact emailed me a receipt that I’m currently still waiting for this probably could’ve been resolved before they even shipped the first one out. Sidenote Chad where’s my receipt. So I called them up this morning told them my situation and they basically said oops but we still have the one in stock will be happy to send it out. My dilemma now is that by the time they ship it out it would get here the night before and that’s not gonna work. Here’s where they have a chance to make it right. I was nice about everything I said it’s not my fault we need to get this thing expedited I want 2 day shipping so I will have a day or two to get them in amongst the rest of the packing and prepping that I already have to do. I own a business and when me or my guy screw up we step up to the plate and own it. I understand people screwup and it was a mistake so I told them right out the gate I’ll meet you guys in the middle you cover half of the shipping and I’ll cover the other half so we both eat it. What more could you ask for from a customer? They chose not to do this and not to take responsibility and put all the extra cost on me. Here’s where I’m stuck I can’t find these parts anywhere else and I need them I don’t want to give these guys my business but I have no choice I made my last purchase with Michigan truck springs. I am shocked with the terrible customer service. PS I need my first receipt Chad.",US,1,2022-06-09T23:46:46Z,Michigan Truck Spring

Nick was absolutely Amazing !!!!! Honest trustworthy and very customer orientated. Although we had to wait 6 months for part of our order the first part shipped out immediately after ordered and arrived very quickly. I was looking for a particular heavy duty Shock for my work Van which carries very heavy materials for my job on a daily basis The Shocks were on a backorder which I already knew as I had ordered from another company and was continuously being told they would ship, given promises that weren't kept and the customer service was awful no rtd calls just awful, I cancelled the order after I somehow found this company and spoke with Nick. He was honest made no unkept promises but kept us in the loop, he also recommended another set for use until I received the set on backorder . which I purchased. I Spoke to him recently and was given an apology and new shipping estimate by end of June. He let me know he felt pretty confident on this as well . Very professional , they arrived mid May !!! So happy!! All companies need the kind of service Nick provided. Instead of making promises he had no control over his honesty made waiting for the product no Problem. .

Great product. Fit is perfect. However when ordering by application a fitment photo was offered for dimensions center bolt to ends and arch. There was nothing about options for bushing diameter.

I had no choice but to pay it to get my customer back on the road. No offer of a discount on product or freight. Guess if there's a next time don't use the automated system just call.

Small mix up with my order. Called MI Truck springs and they took care of it right away. At that point I decided I would add a few more bolts to my order.

I have a 96 bronco, and the front bushing on the rear leaf spring is a different size than the rest of the years of the Full Size Broncos (except for maybe a 95). Before finding this out, I had ordered another bushing from someone else. They didn't have dimensions, just part numbers, so once i found the dimensions on another site, I knew that it wouldn't work. Finally, I found a post that had the right size and part number to order and then found Michigan Truck Spring that had the bushing. The shipping was tough, but they got the bushing here faster, by days, than the other place(couldn't cancel).
Anyway they had it in stock, they got it here fast, and it fit perfectly. I will definitely order from them again.",US,1,2022-05-03T19:44:17Z,Michigan Truck Spring

I received the part and it fit as it should. However, the shipping charges cost more than the part itself. It also took longer to be received than it should have and as the part is a ""pop-off"" valve it should not leak air unless there is more pressure than 150 PSI. The pressure gauge in my Motorhome only gets to 130 PSI before the air dryer purges air, so I am still 20 pounds below where the ""pop-off"" valve should relieve any pressure but I can spray soapy water on the valve and air is still being relieved from the ""pop-off"" valve at all times.",US,1,2022-04-26T16:28:10Z,Michigan Truck Spring

Chucker,1.0,"Great service

Ordered shocks for a Spartan K2 based RV from Michigan Truck Spring with a 12+ week manufacturer delay. Two months later, after searching web, I found another product model number on the manufacturer's website which was available on MTS's website. The appearance of two different product numbers on the manufacturer's applicability chart caused confusion as to whether or not I had ordered the correct part since the chassis has multiple configurations. The MTS rep called the manufacturer and reviewed the specifications of both products to confirm the alternate was in fact a directly compatible product for my application. Quick reply and shipping since the alternate was in stock. Very satisfied with MTS. Hopefully, I will not need shocks again on this vehicle, but if I do, MTS will be my first choice.",US,1,2022-02-24T22:25:38Z,Michigan Truck Spring

Consumer,1.0,"Ryan Symonds at Michigan Truck was like a dog with a bone, and got the result I needed

Okay so looked on line, spoke to Winnebago and my genuine replacement from them was a non starter, as they no longer supported the model on the suspension avenue. Got pushed around by a few people who said maybe maybe not, then looked at Michigan Truck & Spring, sent some messages and went into communication with Ryan Symonds. He asked for part numbers and Winnebago chassis. Took a little time and he came back to me, it ended up as a special run with Firestone doing a replication their original suspension and about 6 months because of lead times from Firestone. But Ryan had his finger on the pulse throughout, and eventually true to his word Ryan dispatched the goods, just before Christmas 2021 and I got them UPS here in England, Great Britain, 2 days later. Very very pleased with outcome, if Michigan Truck cant help you on suspension then I am afraid you are scuppered.

Air lift 1000HD
Fast shipping. Arrived with no damage. Installed on pickup woth no problems.
Followed the instructions and had no problems at all. No air leaks. Ride may be a little harsh but that would be expected. I kept 8psi in spring assist rather than 5psi they call for.
I will be putting on a 1600 pound camper which is below the max weight specified by RAM and should keep the truck level. Probably need to put 25psi inassist once the camper is installed.",US,1,2021-11-07T23:40:11Z,Michigan Truck Spring

I loved the speedy response and detailed and info and solution to the situation. Of course UPS messed up one of the deliveries but Michgan Truck Spring handled that matter as well, provided me a partial refund on my shipping fees (even though it wasn't their fault) since one of the parts arrived late. They got back to m within a day or two with a tracking number for part that was being resent.

Found Michigan Truck Spring online while comparing prices on a particular trailer jack.

The web page had a couple of weight ratings for the jack, 1200 lbs in the item header and 1500 lbs in the item description. I knew the correct value based on the manufacturer's part number, so that mistake in the item description was the only negative I could mention.

Good website, and even better customer service on the phone.
Springs are complicated, and upgrading when your original springs are worn out or were undersized to begin with ( 2000 tacoma) or both... is best done with some personal advice, after you have narrowed the options.

My springs arrived via UPS, not long after I ordered them. Got exactly what I ordered, the price was sure right. I tried emailing one other company in Pennsylvania... and never got any answer.

So there you go. Guys up in Saginaw are keeping the faith, Providing a good industrial product at a good price, and with personal service that shows they care.

I called the agent, Dale, I think who could not explain what had happened with the instock items online. I canceled the delayed order and kept the part that was available. I did reach out to your website with a complaint.
I was called back and told that I could now expect all the order to be canceled as my business was no longer welcome. I was incredulous. I guess I can no longer due business with your online site and I believe I placed an additional review on this treatment.

kent keller,0.2,"JUST DON'T DO IT!

JUST DON'T DO IT!

Ordered a set of leaf springs on June 23, 2021. the original package was delivered by UPS but MINUS the truck springs. It was obvious that the FLIMSY cardboard box had busted open and been re-sealed. The original box weighed-in at 143 lbs!!!! No wonder the FLIMSY cardboard box would not stand up to the UPS shipping process!

In trying to resolve the issue MTS would not DO ANYTHING to get me my springs other than to say"". we have to wait on UPS to find the springs."" Even after admitting that UPS had lost the springs(due to inadequate packing). As a customer, the problem between MTS and UPS was THEIRS, not the customer who had paid for the merchandise!

So I filed a dispute with my CC company because weeks had passed with no indication that MTS actually intended to send me what I paid for!

MTS denied my refund, at this time the springs were still lost in the UPS black-hole, as MTS admitted to, but they refused to give me refund until UPS located the Springs, which if they had been packed properly, would have never been lost by UPS!

Fast forward to 8/26/2021. The CC company finally released my claim so I was told I would be getting my springs NEXT Day AIR... HaHaHa. one week later I received ONE spring, NOT the two I had ordered...

So after several more days of waiting on UPS to ship the 2nd spring I had paid for, MTS finally capitulated and sent me my other spring. This item was delivered on 9/15/2021.

So..... 12 WEEKS later I get my order but not without being treated like a 2nd class citizen by MTS..

I fault BOTH MTS and UPS for this debacle.

HOWEVER I cannot be convinced that if MTS would have packaged the springs properly UPS would not have had such a difficult time with the delivery!

MTS you get the blame for this THREE MONTH debacle!",US,3,2021-09-16T22:35:17Z,Michigan Truck Spring

I received my Cargomaxx XHD Coil spring order promptly. The product was absolutely as described on line. The fit, perfect.
I tow a travel trailer with my Ram 1500 Big Horn and the truck still had the factory springs in it. My tow rating is 8000# and my travel trailer is just over 6000#.
The back end hung very low and rode on the overloads.
I bought the Cargomaxx XHD rear coil springs from Michigan Coil Spring from online.
After the 20 minute installation in my parking lot, with the trailer on now my truck rides level. I gained 4.5"".
Awesome. Everything I hoped for at an incredible price. Beat others hands down on the price.

Do not purchase springs from this company they are a rip off and do not stand behind their products, I purchased part number 43-818 front leaf springs for my 2002 Ford f350 super duty 4x4 with a 7.3 diesel engine to replace my original sagging leaf springs with 300k miles after reading all the positive reviews claiming they brought the truck back up to original ride height plus 1""-2"" extra so I jumped and made my purchase and was immediately disappointed after installation my front end sagged even worse then the original springs with 300k miles so in a pinch I had to buy a mini spring leveling pack pull the leaf springs and install it just to lift the front end back up to where it sat originally!!! Later that day I messaged Michigan truck spring and Monday morning I was told that they believe the springs and worse sagging front end was correct and they wouldn't do anything to remedy my complaint so I informed them I was a mechanic and would be posting this review on their website and recommending any of our shop customers to purchase springs from anywhere else but this company and they quit responding what great customer service haha (NOT!) I should of just ordered the procomp springs for less $ and got better results!

We were not advised that because of the back order our money was refunded automatically taking us out of ""line"" for our order to be filled... it was not said in the email to contact company so as to not loose our spot on our ordering... once we realized our money had been refunded we then contacted the company to confirm we did want the product.

Great service and communication with me on my parts ordered. They actually got me a bilstien front strut that no one had nor could anyone get it tell late July.

Everyone had the same answer “not tell the end of July or later. They had the strut for my 300C at my doorstep earlier than they said they would. And 20-70 dollars cheaper than everyone els! I also got a pair of leaf springs for my truck through them many years ago . They also arrived earlier than predicted and are of higher quality than others that I bought around the same time for my work truck from the Ford dealership. Michigan truck springs are still going strong . Ford’s OE Springs I’ve already broke and now have Michigan truck springs on my work truck as well.

I purchased a rear sway bar kit for a pickup and, while trying to figure out which sway bar kit to go with, had multiple calls - and emails - between myself, customer service, and Michigan Truck Spring's service manager. Not only were the individuals I spoke to patient, informative, and helpful but it was also refreshing (in an age where the customer is seen more as an annoyance) working with Michigan Truck Spring from a customer-business level of interaction.",US,2,2021-03-23T13:22:41Z,Michigan Truck Spring

I purchased a set of Universal Air Lift bags for my 2008 Jeep to help support the plow I installed. I didn’t realize until I received the Air Lift Products that they wouldn’t work on my Jeep.

He sent me the mailing address in an email to return the Air Lift products. And then placed my order for the Timbren Bump stops. I was completely done with everything in under 20 minutes. Anyone who has dealt with over the phone returns and problems, understands that’s really fast!

Nothing but good things to say. I literally searched the world for the air spring I purchased from Trucksprings.

I was kept advised the whole way through the transaction and given a llink to UPS to follow the progress of my items. I can't go without saying that the UPS tracking system is far in advance of other courier services I've dealt with, both internally and internationally. Well done and thank you to the Trucksprings team. You are now in my favourites folder.

Quick processing for order. I placed the order at 5:30am. By the end of the day the order was complete awaiting shipping. Also it was On time shipping. They are Quality springs, my husband was pleased. The only thing we had to do was flip the center bolt around as it was upside down for our vehicle. That's because my husband ordered a different more heavy duty spring. He owns an xterra, but bought Chevy springs. The length of the springs was not correct to the info on website. They were almost 2 inches shorter than advertised. But he's a welder, he added length to his shackles, no problem. I wish the hardened bolts came as an option to add. We had to cut the old bolts off our truck and hunt them down at a hardware store. All in all we are happy with everything.

I ordered a rotor hub assembly off the web site on 1/30 and received it 5 days later. Great service in my eye. Turns out the two options available in their catalog, as well as any catalog including Dodge, are not what is on my truck. Mike got me an RGA for return. I went to UPS to send it back, they wanted more than I paid, parts and shipping, to send it back. Called Mike back and they arranged a return tag for the price they originally charged me for shipping. Having to pick price, quality, or speed, I think they're a rare case to hit all three.

Went through the website to order springs for my truck. I only found I set of springs when I purchased my springs. I recieved the springs and found that they count all the springs. So I needed a 7 spring not 6 spring. Apparently the springs are scattered out on the website. So you have to go to page 4 and find the 7 spring. I get I would have to pay for the springs since the price is different. However, I was told I would pay shipping on the correct springs and shipping to return the 6 springs.

Very helpful on the phone. Airlift 5000 and the 25980ez compressor arrived on time and everything was as promised. This unit was installed in the bed of a 2020 f-250 Tremer near the tailgate on the drivers side. I Have dual batteries on the 7.3 engine. Drilled 4 holes in each corner on the mount (5/16) then used a 1/4 spacer and mounted it with expanded nuts (1/4). Installed the wiring all the way up to the battery on the drivers side and used #1 on the uplifter switches for ignition activation. This took some time to install, however the end result is a quality job and the compressor stays clean.

Install was easy although there's no instructions, but that can be sourced via Google searches no problem though, but you should probably have an idea of uninstall/install process beforehand anyway.

Mr Dave Anderson,
I can't say enough good about his desire to help me and my company while representing his, employer.
In my eyes he represented my side better.
He solved all my needs effortlessly, and had the parts in the mail the same day.
The shipping was incredibly fast.
As far as fit and quality of parts there is no comparisons to give the parts were well built, and at least in my eyes far superior to the competitions..
They fit perfect and changed the way my truck handles and sits..

Most can't appreciate what that truck does in a day..
Dave did..
I depend on that truck everyday to keep the wheels rolling at the shop and in the field.

I had a hard time finding bushings for the leaf springs on the 75 k20 Chevy truck I'm building. The front and rear springs are not stock so I had to go by measurements. Michigan had all the measurements within the item's description which proved invaluable. Their prices were competitive if not lower than any other place I looked. Communication was outstanding and shipping was reasonably quick. Products look to be of good quality and after I finish beating my brains out getting the old bushings out they should fit fine. I'd buy again from them and will look to them first the next time I need suspension parts.",US,1,2020-09-26T22:38:20Z,Michigan Truck Spring

I only took off one star because yes it was partly my fault for not looking closer but come on, the axles are sold in pares so should the mounting plates.

I reached out to the guys at MTS and Ryan contacted me and asked me to describe my truck and what I was trying to accomplish by installing support springs of some type. He actually suggested a different product than I thought I needed. Not only are the Timbren springs perfect, they were a 20-minute install and they were 1/2 price of what I was originally looking at. I couldn’t be happier. Excellent customer service. I’m ordering another set for my wife’s truck as well as my dad’s truck. I highly recommend MTS.

I’m sure that helped with such a fast delivery time but Michigan Spring got them packaged up and sent out ASAP! I couldn’t have asked for anything more.

Nolan,0.6,"My 2013 f 150 ups and downs

My 2013 f 150 rides a heck of a lot smoother now. It has 140000 miles on it. The owner before me upgraded the 3 leaf , and added an extra leaf. The extra leaf cracked, so I upgraded the whole set with HD leaf kit from Michigan.

What I learned..
I learned that the part that bolts down to the axle is too short, so I need to upgrade those and get longer ones.

I ordered the regular leaf's, and I have a 9 foot bed, so I took their Michigan top 2 leaf's off. And put my stock ones on. Still works great.

I had to move the parking break line to above the leaf's, instead of the stock way, below them.

It's best to have 2 people, 6 inch C clamp, very wide channel locks, air gun, hardened socket set, swivel for your air gun.

Like I said, I wasn't going to send them back, I ordered wrong. I did it the hard way, but I got through it in 4 hours tops.

Oh yeah. The way Ford puts its books in, I had to drop the gas tank, and unbolt the muffler. I put the driver side gas tank bolt back in so I could easily take it out. Re mounted. Then cut off excess so it didn't damage the gas tank. Thanks Ford.


All in all. Very smooth ride. It did add air to my wheel compartment. I would say 3 to 5 inches easily. Very noticeable.

I called Michigan Truck Springs after I’d already placed an order with another company. The first company promised/implied the order would be shipped same day if ordered before 2pm, and should reach me within 3-5 business days. I called the first company back to dispute billing the following day and never reached a live person (sat on hold for over 1hr). Called again when I got an email saying my order was delayed, same result as before...nobody would answer.
So I called Michigan Truck Spring and worked with them. First off, you could tell they knew what they were doing. They took the time to look up everything, answer all my questions, and then double check before we ended the call. I called the first company back and cancelled the order (didn’t answer again so I had to wait for a call back). I then called Michigan back, got ahold of them right away, and placed the order. Got a receipt emailed right away, and then another email with a tracking number showing they had shipped the order the same day. It was shipped on a Friday and arrived Wednesday, a day earlier than expected! Installation was straightforward with nothing to “MacGyver”.

I ordered this part a week ago and paid for priority shipping. I ordered on a Saturday but it didn’t actually ship from Michigan via USPS until Thursday! I needed the part No later than Friday. While I recognize that paying another $7 for 2-day shipping via UPS would have helped, the 2-3 day shipping quoted to my address was a complete joke and I didn’t get the part in time to help my Active Duty Military buddy to start his cross-country move.

I can’t actually speak to the product, because it’s STILL not here after a week and my buddy is long gone WITHOUT the sumo springs that would have really helped him with towing all of his gear.

UPDATE:
Springs received a full week after processing. Not Michigan Springs’ fault with the delivery delays. Next time I’ll just spend the extra money and ship UPS. I recommend doing the same.",US,1,2020-07-14T00:07:41Z,Michigan Truck Spring

Brian,0.8,"Most everything went together according…

Most everything went together according to the instructions. Kit was complete, but I think the addition of two low cost items would make the installation a little smoother:
- extra 'anti-chafing' for the air lines. I purchased 8 feet of 'wire loom' and it looks like it covered every possible point of wear.
- paper or light cardboard template for drilling the holes in the frame. Perhaps a flap from the box could have this printed on it on the inside - and a dotted line on where to cut it off (and where to align it on the frame)

My truck is old [328,000 miles] and the springs sag (else I would not have needed this kit). Raising the frame and holding it with a jackstand was effective, then a floor jack was used to raise the axle enough to remove tire/wheel assy. - then was used to lower the axle enough to get the air bag assy. in place.

- also, just a minor detail - mentioning the size of wrenches and/or sockets used might be a little helpful - including the need for a deepwell socket for both the 'under axle' bolts and the air fittings...

Very happy with the initial feelings of the solidness, but still have not hooked a trailer to it for the ultimate test...

Howard,1.0,"My experience with Michigan Truck…

My experience with Michigan Truck Spring (MTS) was very pleasant. I was particularly pleased with the customer service. I called several times trying to decide on a spring and then trying to find the correct hardware, each time I called I received pleasant and knowledgeable service. In addition to the good customer service, the prices were very competitive and my order shipped quickly. Before settling on MTS I called a different spring place and had a very different experience, not knowledgeable at all (although he tried to sound it) and not pleasant at all. In fact he tried to pressure me into buying before I had made up my mind on what weight rating spring to buy, and he was very rude when I said I wasn't quite ready to order. I was so pleased when speaking with the service rep at MTS, and he said ""no problem just call me at extension... when you're ready or if you have any other questions."" I knew then that I was going to order from them, and as I said the rest of the order went great as well. Thanks Michigan Truck Spring!",US,3,2020-07-04T04:24:29Z,Michigan Truck Spring

Absolutely horrible experience. Bought a 5th wheel hitch to go in my pickup truck to haul a camper. Ordered it on 6/16, still wasn't here as of yesterday. Called them to find out where it's at, because the tracking number provided by them wasn't working, it was an XPO tracking number. They told me yesterday that it was checked in at a Pa terminal, as it came from Michigan, got to Pay on the 19th. They told me ONLY YESTERDAY FROM ME HAVING TO CALL THEM, that it was returned to them due to an error in either XPO or MTS computer..... Not one phone call to me from the 19th to yesterday telling me what happened. Never again will I buy from them. Called for my refund, see what happens.

This place lacks the basic phone skills needed to run a business... I placed a rather large order for parts using PayPal.. Somehow, MTS ships out half the order claiming ""Processing problems with my payment"" and instead of contacting me on the phone about the payment so they could ship out the rest of my order, they just let it sit there for 10 Business days before I had to call to find out what was going on. And when all was said and done there was no problem with PayPal, they (MTS) screwed up processing the payment. Long story short it took me more than 3 weeks to get parts from this place. All because they don't know how to operate a telephone. First and last time I will ever purchase from this place. Edit: Within 1 hour of posting this review, they run to reply and dispute my story. I wish they put half as much effort into contacting me when my order was sitting there on the floor.

Nick was very helpful and wasn’t bothered by having to reach out to two
manufacturers or by them sticking him on hold to get the answers we needed. Firestone Ride Rite kit arrived quickly, in good shape and with the correct parts. Fit was perfect even though it on drivers side you need to reverse the mounting bolts to clear the brake lines. Passenger side didn’t look like one hole would line up and be able to get a nut on the bolt but it worked out fine. I reversed these bolts to match other side as well. With 10psi in each bag it rides better, high winds don’t move it as much as much and very little roll when corning on a 2006 Tundra Doublecab Limited. Not used for towing yet but it will be a much more level and more comfortable ride. There not the cheapest but they are the best in my book. Very pleased.

This has been great.
I located what I thought was the part I wanted easily on the website. I couldn't find one of the critical dimensions (It must be standard), so I called and talked to a fellow named Mike. He found out what that dimension was and called me back within 30 minutes. He also said the part had to be ordered, since it was not in stock.

I received one email telling me one of the Items I ordered was not in stock and would take 4 or 5 business days to get it in stock and if that was ok with me, I replied yes as long as I could get it by June 16th. I had not heard from them for several days well past the 4 or 5, I emailed them about my order and received no response so after a a week or so I figured they didn't do my order due to the fact that my bank card had not been charged.

Installed these last week on my ram 1500. I haul a small fifth wheel about 8,000 lb. Prior to the installation of these variable rate springs, I had a lot of sway and the rear end dipped quite a bit. Installation was easy and greatly improved my ride. I would recommend these for anybody doing towing on a light duty truck.

VICTOR,0.6,"Frustrated

Order and shipping process are easy and prompt. The truck spring itself is not what we were expecting and does not work properly. After our hood has been completely opened, the inner spring gets caught on the outer rod and prevents the hood from closing. We have to wiggle the rod and gently leave it positioned in order to close the hood. Extremely frustrating and will likely break once we forget to double/triple check hood spring before closing.",US,1,2020-05-12T21:04:16Z,Michigan Truck Spring

Excellent quality leaf springs. I have an 05 colorado Z71 and bought the HD rear springs but had a serious issue with the ride height. It puts you where a 3""-4"" lift height would be so I had to compensate for the serious height difference by turning up my torsion keys to where it put only a slight angle on my cv shafts and its still way off from being close to level. Hopefully they will settle down a bit but if not I will have to add differential spacers to my transfer case and do a flip ball joint and a few other things to get it even close up front.

Joseph,1.0,"Perfection at its finest.

What I would consider to be perfect customer service is exactly everything that MTS delivered from beginning to end even in the stir of commotion. They didn't initially send the order however, it was with good reason once I learned they just wanted to confirm my 2 orders of the same item (I assume to avoid an accidental double order/charge) once verified my shipment was underway in less than 24 hours. Put it this way, I'm not too concerned In saying that my parts review will also likely be a 10/10.
Thank you to all of you being so prompt and profound in your lines of work. Precision over speed and you all nailed both.

Rear leaf spring to axle U Bolts where very loose on 2004 Duramax. Axle and suspension shifting around and clunking. Needed to fix immediately. Ordered 3/4"" u bolts and nuts. Received 1 week later, all good so far. Was inspecting bolts, nuts and washers and realized they sent 5/8"" nuts and washers not 3/4"". Called immediately and reported the problem and asked if they could send correct nuts and washers by 1st class mail or some faster shipping method. Said would pass info on Mon. morning to office. Shipped this small, light weight package again by UPS, and I had to wait until Fri. 6 pm to receive them. I would have thought they would have expedited the shipping after their mistake, and knowing this item was urgently needed. I then tried calling them on Fri. to verify the torque on the u bolts and to ask what size the nuts would be. I called on and off for a couple of hours and no answer. Other sites stated 1 1/8"" socket for the 3/4"" u bolt nut, so I went and purchased an 1 1/8"" impact socket. When the nuts and washers arrived they are not 1 1/8"" but appear to be metric. They measure 32nd over 1 inch. Now I have to make another trip and buy another socket. This should have been a simple straight forward project and ended up taking forever, costing much more in gas and time, and turned into a real pain in the butt. I gave 2 stars because the bolts appear to be good quality.",US,1,2020-04-11T18:41:19Z,Michigan Truck Spring

Rich,0.4,"Poor communication. Don't care after they get your money.

Talked with Steve Young 7 or so months before making the final order for replacement leaf springs for my little Dodge Dakota. We talked on the phone about adding an additional leaf to the spring pack since I plan on towing soon and I also wanted an inch to inch and a half of additional clearance when not towing. He suggested they add a ""repair leaf"" we talked it over and it sounded like a good option. A few months later when I had the money together I emailed him, replying to the original email chain, to get all the part numbers correct. I reminded him of the ""repair leaf"" and he reminded me it would be $100 to have them install it. I called to put in the order and when I received the package, quite quickly to their credit, it had everything in the boxes.... just nothing installed in the leaf pack. When I emailed saying I was disappointed, Steve Youngs reply:
""I am sorry you are not happy with your order, I thought we had discussed my service department installing those repair leaves for an upcharge of $50.00 per spring. Again I do apologize you are not happy with our service.""
That is all, nothing more.
They didn't even cut the ""repair spring"" so it could be installed easily, just two 60 inch long pieces of spring steel in the box with the rest of the parts. It would cost more in shipping to send the parts back than it will to have the add-a-leaf put in locally. I could return them but I will be out $280+ for shipping.

If your looking for custom or semi-custom work, check your local options before ordering from Michigan Truck Spring. You will pay more in shipping if you don't make thing explicitly clear.",US,1,2020-04-08T03:37:04Z,Michigan Truck Spring

Great people to work with. I needed a new Track Bar (also called a Panhard Rod) for my 2001 Diesel pusher Winnebago Motorhome on a Freightliner custom chaissis. I had done a lot of research looking for a replacement for the one that FL wanted $600 for, but wasn't even in stock at present. TRUCK SPRING and Steve in particular, was very accommodating and pleasant to work with. I had numbers from other websites and was able to use a shorter (similar bar) that, by the measurements (with the exception of the length), matched the specs of the Freightliner part. Steeve took the time to go over the specs for his part and my worn out part. That helped me assure myself that the removable ends would work on my bar. Part from Truck Spring cost $160 (Best price I found). They had 13 in stock. Only took 3 days to arrive and parts worked perfectly.

On my last phone inquiry I was told that the shocked had shipped on Thursday. I have still not seen a tracking confirmation now a few days later.

Disgruntled Customer,0.2,"Late, Wrong, Difficult Customer Service!

Recently ordered coil springs for the front of my 3/4 ton Ram snowplow. Nowhere on the order page does it say 4x2 model. It does say they are for a snow plow. The springs showed up late and are the wrong ones. The diameter is way off (too small). When I called back and told the guy who answered the phone that they were wrong he immediately said “his hands are tied” because I had installed them! I only told him that they were the wrong ones. He told me I ordered ones for a 4x2. Doesn’t say that on the page! Asked me three times if I had installed them. How many times do I have to say no, they are the wrong ones? Way too small diameter! Couldn’t find the right ones for me so I’m waiting for a return label. Should have ordered Timbren!

I see the reply, and yet I still didn’t notice anywhere on the order page or my receipt that it fits a 4x2. Now I’m off to UPS to pay to return a 43lb. box to Michigan.

I ordered a set of German made Bilstein shocks. Michigan Truck sent an email letting me know that the shocks are special order and would take 12 to 16 weeks to deliver.

Parts I bought to do a leaf spring overhaul fit well with a reasonable price. I would have liked a kit with everything to do a complete overhaul but isn't offered. The rear hangers came with bolts but not the helper spring brackets and was another added cost at the hardware store. The website could use a little help. I had to search the vehicle two different ways in order to find certain parts. The website and the person I called wasn't really clear on what U bolts I needed and was told I had to measure them. I ended up going to ford for them and the front hangers where I didn't need to measure anything. Parts came it wrapped and shipped very professionally and very fast. They also looked well made with good craftsmanship.
Nobody else seems to offer a kit with everything so it not really a knock on this company. I would and probably will use them again.",US,1,2019-11-25T05:36:24Z,Michigan Truck Spring

Service was excellent.
Firestone product was correct and good.
Your material price includes UPS ground delivery.
I paid $169 extra for next day UPS delivery.
Kind of steep, but I needed to be on the road.
I am used to Next day UPS being delivered before 10:30 AM,
We stood around all morning waiting for delivery.
UPS finally delivered the shipment between 12:30 and 1:00 PM.
Since it was nor delivered when we expected, the repair shop had to go on to other projects, Therefore our repairs could not be completed in time for me to proceed that day. I lost half a day of travel time and could not get underway until the next day.

Ordered these for a customers truck that was on my lift apart. They were measured to what they indicated on site. I even called to verify fitment and gentleman said yes these are the number you need. I received the spings in a timely manner and took them out to find that the spring arch wasn’t as much as i need and when i went to install them the centering bolt or pin was in upside down, i had to clamp them together and remove and reinstall the proper way for installation. Very dissapointed. I am a 3 bay shop that is very busy and don’t have time to leave a truck sitting on my lift for day for them to correct their problems.

Hitch is fine. Instructions are defective. All pictures are reversed. For example on a 2019 Camry LE Hybrid, the exhaust is on the driver's side. In the pictures it looks like it's on the passenger side. The picture of the plastic undercarriage piece showing where to cut to fit is also backwards. And the hand drawn lines where the instructions show material removal is incorrect. On the single exhaust Camry like mine all that is needed is a 2""x12"" slot on the passenger side to accommodate the vertical flange of the hitch on the passengers side.",US,1,2019-10-30T11:48:03Z,Michigan Truck Spring

Mike,1.0,"Not just for trucks - my sailboat story

My story is about the excellent catalogue of information with technical details and dimensions, and the pricing on products and delivery options. I purchased ""HB-396 Harris Leaf Spring Bushing - Type 1"" to use as an insert on the gooseneck of my sailboat - a very critical part for a sailboat as it takes the entire load of the sail and boom. The OEM insert has been discontinued. The OD of the insert must fit snugly into the ID of the boom and the ID of the insert must snugly capture the OD of the gooseneck pin. A flange is necessary to keep the insert from being pushed out of position and being ""lost"" in the boom. When I was faced with finding a replacement I looked at images on Google and found these items - I didn't even know what they were! ...but they looked like they might work. How in the world would I find one with the exact dimensions I needed? Michigan Truck Springs catalog provided the answer. I was able to enter the dimensions and search the detailed drawings of the components with ease and confidence. I bought two bushings to test the idea. I am still using the first one and it shows very little wear after one year of hard sailing (about 200 hours of sailing). I have now purchased 8 more which should last me around 20 years (longer than my boat or I will last!) and total cost for all 10 is under $20 including shipping. This same item listed in a sailing catalogue would cost $10 to $15 each. The on-line catalogue is a valuable tool that Michigan Trucks has made available - a lot of hard work to create and maintain.",US,3,2019-09-14T13:56:09Z,Michigan Truck Spring

DENIS,1.0,"Buy Local??? Why punish yourself unnecessarily?

Following too many years of 'supporting local retailers' (and being ripped off), I have adopted a policy of rewarding those who make the buying experience worthwhile even if it my money goes offshore. For instance, the price of after-market airbags for my vehicle in Australia is at least $350 plus delivery costs. Buying from Michigan Truck Spring in the USA was desirable because the initial cost of $US106 plus $70 delivery plus currency conversion penalty totalled approx $AU277 and still delivered to my address within 5 days. What does that say about Australian retail margins and service?

If every interaction they have is as amazing as mine, this place is off the charts. I called with an urgent issue. Steve found that he would be able to order the item I needed but to get it to me within a week would require an upcharge of over a hundred dollars for expedited shipping. I was in a bind as I have to have to part. Without me asking, he checked and advised he could have it drop shipped from the factory to my house. Not only was there no upcharge, my shipping was free and arrived two days earlier than expected. This place will always get my return business.

Good Service. I have ordered a few things from MTS over the years. They have always been good to work with. This time I needed new leaf springs for an old trailer. I was hoping to get some a bit stronger. I sent pics and measurements to them asking of what I wanted might fit. Ryan took the time to get a spring, measure it and send me a photo. We decided it would not work.

So I ordered springs to match the originals on Friday. Got them on Tuesday.

The only thing I might add is the listing online showed the new springs to have 9/16"" bolt hole. When I got them, there was no bushing. I will not ding them on this as I was going to have to use my old 1/2"" bushings anyway. If that would be an issue for you, check before you order.",US,3,2019-08-01T13:27:21Z,Michigan Truck Spring

These folks were GREAT time wise. I ordered, they shipped PDQ. Only monkey wrench in the process was when UPS driver left the package (allegedly) on my elevated front porch rather than my side door. Naturally, the package was too irresistible for some parasitic thief not to steal it.... while I was home... but in the garage.

Kenneth,0.8,"Took nearly two weeks to receive the…

Took nearly two weeks to receive the leaf springs at no fault of MTS. Evidently the brand new state of the art Atlanta UPS facility has some major bugs to work out. Once received, seems the rubber grommet on one of the spring straps came loose and was lost in shipping. Despite the hassle, Bob in shipping was a joy to deal with and quickly addressed both issues. Lost one star due to a fit issue. The nut on the spring pack was larger than the hole in the stock Ford spring plate. Creative use of a 1/2"" drill bit and a dremel grinding wheel allowed me to enlarge the hole in the 1/4"" steel plate and the springs installed easily afterwards.",US,1,2019-07-25T00:43:32Z,Michigan Truck Spring

Brian,0.2,"SUPER SLOW SERVICE! Never will buy again.

The deciding factor that made me choose ordering from this company was their claim of quick shipping. They claimed to ship stock items in one day.
I ordered Tuesday evening and received an email on Wednesday that my order had shipped. However, in fact, it DID NOT ship. The tracking showed that only a shipping label had been created! Likewise, Thursday morning it still had not shipped. It was Thursday evening before USPS received the package.
My order was very small in size but I paid $14 for priority shipping so I would have it by Saturday. Tracking says I should get a Monday, which is virtually a week after ordering!!!

Greg,0.2,"Terrible

Terrible,

I ordered these springs on June 22nd, I called on the 26th to find out where the part were and was told they were shipped out the same day and should arrive by Friday ""today"" the 28th. Mind you I was expecting them to be here two days ago for install since my client was supposed to be leaving today the 28th. They did not arrive and come to find out now that I received the tracking # that they were not shipped until the 26th. Now they will not be here until the 3rd and my client is ringing me a new one because you guys lied to me.

Who ever handled this order lied to me and has caused me problems and I hope that this problem employee gets this review and is delt with because this is uncalled for. If there was a problem I should have been advised of it instead of finding out last minute like this. Now my client has lost money on reservations for the 4th of July that they had planned because of you and someone should have to pay them back for that and it shouldn't be me because your company lied and didn't do what you were supposed to do. This is so messed up on so many levels I don't even know what to say any more.",US,1,2019-06-29T01:21:11Z,Michigan Truck Spring

I ordered a set of leaf springs and shocks for a 2002 Dodge pickup. Leaf springs shipped in a day or two, and one of the two leaf springs arrived via United Parcel Something or other (the ones with the brown trucks without mentioning names). Shocks were shipped to me directly from the manufacturer and arrived a few days later. Still no second leaf spring. Called their Customer service rep. twice. C.S.R. forwarded the issue to ""Bob"". Bob handled the situation and shipped another leaf spring. It took an extra 2-3 weeks to get the problem resolved, but Bob Fischer and the other C.S.R.'s resolved the problem.

Been shipped or not? So maybe in my opinion it is not a good idea to ask for a review or rating before I at least get a tracking number or status of my order.",US,2,2019-06-13T03:21:22Z,Michigan Truck Spring

Received spring bushings. These are 1/2"" ID and I knew I would have to turn the OD down to fit my spring eyelets. While turning ran into a lot of air pockets in each piece.

Well, they are pretty knowledgeable about springs. I ran into a spot where they only had one spring in stock but I wanted two. But, I purchased the one because I really only needed one at that time. Once I got to installing it (3 mos. later), I decided to order the other one so's to do the job I originally intended. When I got the other spring, it was a different mfg. and the cross member bolts didn't match up. I had to pay the shipping back on the 2nd spring. ($91.00) I did because they wouldn't special order the matching one until they received the RMA one. I asked if they could pick up half the shipping but I never got a reply. But, at least I now have two matching springs. :)",US,1,2019-05-07T02:18:00Z,Michigan Truck Spring

VIDAR KLØVNING,1.0,"Little better packing

I purcased some brake parts for an old Scania 110 truck that I am restoring. The parts was very quickly shipped out -of course it takes some time to get them to Norway, but thats the way it is.
Due to the long shipping the package had start to tear down and parts almost falling out, -but luckely the packing was holding fearly tougether and all the items was there.
So an advise to pack it even a little better -spesially when it should go overseas.
The parts looked very very good, and the quality looks to be high, -spesially for the price that is very good.
I will defently recommend this to others -and will for sure get more parts from here if needed.

David,1.0,"Replacement front leafs for my 1999 Ford Super Duty 4x4 Super Cab

The original Ford drivers front leaf spring broke on my 1999 Ford Super Duty 4x4 Super Cab short box 8800 GVW, the springs are a T code spring capacity 2,030 lbs. ea. They are more expensive than the X code springs that have 2,630 lbs. capacity so I stepped up to a set of the X codes which will level my truck and be better when I use my snow plow.
After researching 6-7 sites on the internet I settled on Michigan Truck Spring, they had solid info and the best price for the Ford X springs, they are fairly close so shipping wasn't bad, and I got them in two days.",US,1,2019-03-23T00:52:27Z,Michigan Truck Spring

Matthew,0.8,"Quality Product. Slight modification required.

The rear leaf springs for my 1990 Toyota pickup arrived promptly and in good condition. My only issue is that the bump stop mounts on the replacement springs do not match that of the stock leaf springs that are on the truck. This required some cutting down of the factory bump stop in order to re-install",US,1,2019-01-23T22:10:16Z,Michigan Truck Spring

Thomas,1.0,"Great Service!

Michigan Truck Spring had what I was looking for in stock (1 )where others did not. Maybe I was just lucky in this, but it annoys me when businesses on line advertise a product but expect a customer to wait for it to come from God knows where.

Also, these guys had my order on my doorstep almost next day. Almost like they are in my backyard, not 800 miles away.

Will be my first stop shop for other coming projects.",US,1,2019-01-23T18:12:42Z,Michigan Truck Spring
