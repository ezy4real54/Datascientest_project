Nathan Nickel,0.6,"Not very impressed

Not very impressed. Ordered an item, the wrong item was shipped. Very limited stock and they could not find the correct part in stock anywhere. While working on a solution I discovered that I was able to use part of the order but due to their return policies they had to have the whole thing back in order to credit me any money. So instead of keeping the part that would work (which I will be ordering through a different vendor) and crediting me for the difference between the cost of the part they shipped me, I am returning a perfectly good one that could have been installed last week and this prolonged my project. Now just waiting on them to credit my account before I order from elsewhere.",US,1,2022-08-16T03:45:54Z,Marine Parts Source

Bernie Hyland,0.8,"Crusader 8.1 riser kit

I purchased a Crusader riser kit and it included an odd number of gaskets. Each riser requires two gaskets on the top and bottom of each riser (8 total per kit) with the pass thru and block off plates sandwiched between them. There were only 6 gaskets in the kit, enough for one riser properly installed. The risers also had bare unpainted areas on them.

My order also specified a 3/4 npt to 1 inch hose barb. I received a 1""npt to 1 inch hose barb instead of the correct item. This is probably the result of multiple items appearing under the same part number on the website.

I've ordered many parts from MPS in the past and this is the first time I've had any issues with an order. The items are always correct, well packaged and shipped promptly.",US,2,2022-08-07T23:59:39Z,Marine Parts Source

I received my order and when I had time to install, I was disappointed the kit was missing the inlet strainer. I called and sent pictures of received parts. Then was told one will be sent to me. 4 days have gone by and I have not received it yet. You would think it would be expedited shipping. It got sent ground.
The mounting bracket was also bent and I was told to straighten it out.
I'm sure my purchase was just a drop in the bucket but wish it was handled differently since none of the discrepancies were my fault.

I've been buying from Marine Parts Source for the past 6 years. I am a shopper. If there is a deal or bargain or low price I am going to find it. But low price is only a consideration if you trust the place. We all know there are scam sites that offer half price but don't actually have anything to sell. But Marine Parts Source ALWAYS delivers what they say when they say. I'm moving to the Bahamas where marine parts are stupid expensive and so I wanted to make a bulk purchase of sacrificial anodes. Marine parts source had all I wanted to buy (like $1000 worth of zinc and aluminum anodes) at the lowest prices on the web. I did not believe the prices were real so I actually called them to see if they were still in business. A person immediately answered my call and helped me find everything I was looking for.

We have ordered a lot from Marine Parts Source and they usually do an excellent job. However, our most recent order fell short of expectations.

We ordered some OEM Volvo Stern Drive Paint, but when it arrived, one of the cans was damaged. The cap was shattered and when we used the paint, the valve stuck so that the paint continuously sprayed. Hard to get good results.

Likely, the can was damaged in transit. It could have been packed better.

I wouldn't hesitate to use Marine Parts Source again, but I may request that the parts are packed better in the future.

Beware this company may offer free shipping but they charge it back to you in addition to you paying the shipping to return plus a restocking fee.

Just make sure you don't need to return something unless it is their mistake or defective.
Response to MPS's - I will say that they are consistent and stick to their policy and if you read the response then need I say more about the tone and matter of fact attitude and hardball approach.

I told them these dont work, they dont care. Eff you MPN. BTW the oem onan impeller this was supposed to replace costsabout $55 from cummins/onan and 92.47 on MPN.

Chris Blanchette,0.8,"Marine Parts Source should scrap UPS as their Carrier

With regard to Marine Parts Source, they have been great but they should consider not using UPS as their shipping source in the future. We are in Canada, just across the water from Marine Parts Source in Michigan. The item I purchased cost $84.03 but the shipping cost was quite high at $39.85 which I accepted because it had to cross the border into Canada. That was not the worst of it though. When the package arrived, UPS would not leave it at the door which is a problem for me because I work and not available at home during the day. I was not informed of this when ordering and I don't blame Marine Parts, I believe this is a UPS issue. The reason they did not leave the package at the door is because they charged me a brokerage fee of $56.00 on top of the $39.85 I already paid for shipping. I essentially had to pay $95.85 to UPS for a part that only cost me $84.03.
So I called UPS to pay the fee over the phone. What else could I do other than let them ship the item back to Marine Parts Source and loose all the money I paid to UPS at a minimum. The problem did not end here. After I paid UPS they sent a message to the dispatcher to drop the package off without collecting the fee because it was already paid, but the delivery person did not deliver the package apparently because they did not read the revised instructions when delivering the package. I called UPS again and they said it would be delivered first thing in the morning. I still did not receive the package. At this point I have called a third time and talked with a supervisor so hopefully I get the package later today.
My message here is for Marine Parts Source. If you want to remain a viable choice to your over the border customers, you should not offer UPS as a shipping option but find another courier that will not have such ridiculous charges. This is just UPS creating unnecessary complexity and taking a huge money grab at Marine Parts Source expense.",CA,1,2021-11-09T19:11:53Z,Marine Parts Source

Len Roland,0.8,"Webasto FCF Platinum Series 12,000 BTU

The AC was fairly priced and shipped quickly. UPS delivered it very late the day of delivery so installation extended into the next day. Box was pretty beat up and had been dropped somewhere along it’s trip. Tape was put over the spot that hit the ground so they knew it was an issue. Too dark to really get a good look when delivered and damage was under the box. One corner of the pan was slightly bent but the AC works as advertised. Didn’t have the time “window” to send it back and wait for another one. Mechanically the AC is a pretty simple installation. Getting the old one out was almost more of a job. Installed in a 1986 36” Carver Mariner. Have to build a box but should go OK. Churns out 43 deg air and heat works fine. I’d recommend FCF Platinum and this dealer.

Tasha,0.2,"Bad customer service

We purchased a marine starter for our re-manned engine from Marine Parts Source. This was a Arco starter that was installed after engine break in by a licensed mechanic. After a couple starts we heard a cracking noise coming from the starter. After further troubleshooting we noticed the drive gear was cracked in 3 places. The engine had started fine with the old starter so this was not caused by the engine itself, it was a manufacturing issue of the starter. We sent back the starter to MPS and waited for a credit or new starter to be sent back however this was not the case. They spoke with Arco and let us know the drive gear is not under warranty and was probably caused by ""engine misfire, improper starter/engine rotation, or engaging the starter when an engine is already running."" All things we know to be untrue. After talking with the MPS rep, we were only offered a discount for a new starter instead of a replacement or credit. This is just bad customer service. At least provide a credit so we can purchase a new one. We will not be buying from MPS again.",CA,1,2021-08-03T16:26:45Z,Marine Parts Source

Our RV toilet went out and we are on the road. The repair guy said it would take at least a week to get the seal we needed so I got on the internet to find someone to get us the seal overnight. I found Marine Parts Source and gave them a call to see if I could get the part overnighted even though it was kind of late in the day. I’m happy to say I received the part at 10:30 the next morning. The repair guy was in shock I had the part so soon. Thanks Marine Parts Source for the excellent service!",US,1,2021-07-22T15:04:41Z,Marine Parts Source

So, I said all I needed was the impeller, housing gaskets, oil tube o'ring and shaft seal. She said I've got that.

Boater,0.4,"Customer Service SNAFU

Well, The parts are good anyhow. Here's the thing: I ordered these parts and the receiving shipping date was given as Wednesday June 23rd. We were on vacation until Friday the 25th, so I quickly messaged MPS asking for a shipping date that would arrive on Friday or Saturday (25th-26th). They sent me an email that stated they would ship OUT on THURSDAY the 24th. There was NO WAY that would reach me by Friday or Saturday. I immediately messaged back, asking what's up with that?? They totally ghosted me and the parts arrived on Monday the 28th... SMH. Wow, 'Murica. Tone deaf or what?!?",US,1,2021-06-28T22:30:32Z,Marine Parts Source

Kathy Marie,0.2,"Make sure you know more than they do about their products

I ordered a pump for almost $200.
When I received it and read the instructions before installing it something I read made me think I may not have ordered the right pump. I called the company the man was very rude to me. He told me I did have the right pump for what I was trying to do although I don't think he was even listening to me. He acted like I was bothering him. I installed the pump and low and behold it was the wrong kind. It didn't have a pressure switch like the man said it did. I called them and they won't take it back because it was installed. I spoke with Nick about the return very polite and helpful but he said management said no return in this item. So I give them 1 star. I guess I have an expensive paperweight.",US,1,2021-06-27T21:02:23Z,Marine Parts Source

Brad Carter,0.6,"Could be more for local boaters!

Really like the technical service of MPS. However, I have a warehouse in the city next to me (White House) and I am no longer allowed to do will call. The reasoning behind shutting this down was it kept the local people too busy. As a business person, I am not sure why it would be shut down due to demand. MPS is the only source in town. I would suggest hiring a local student to work part time and man the counter for will-call pickups. Recently I had to pay $40 for a part to be delivered one town over when I should have been able to pick it up locally. Again, the technical service is awesome. Good selection.

It was great to be able to find my parts. I ordered two fuel pump repair kits. However, they were not an exact match for my unit. I was charged $16.00 for shipping for something that could have been sent in a bubble envelope for about $2.00. When I called about a return I was told that it would cost more in shipping than it was worth. Plus a 20% restock fee. Due to the cost I just kept them. $40.00 for nothing that I could use.So then I bought a new fuel pump and paid another $16.00 in shipping.

I ordered two refrigerators for my boat from them and paid with a credit card. I needed to get them shipped ASAP as they had to go to San Diego, get picked up to cross the Mexican border and trucked to Cabo where the boat is. They later called me and requested that I wire the money as their accounting dept flagged this order to not accept a credit card??? This was only a $5k purchase. I unwillingly wired them the money as I had an upcoming charter I needed the fridges for. Needless to say, they delayed the shipment almost a week and screwed up my charter. They offered me no compensation in return for all of the trouble and loss of my charter. I asked them what their amount was to require money to be wired instead of using a credit card and they had no answer.

Norm pedersen,1.0,"Stand up company!

I ordered 2 tune up kits for my 454xl crusaders. The price point was great. I ordered on a Tuesday one came Friday and the other on Monday. They came from two different warehouses. In one of the kits a piece of the distributor cap was broken off. I emailed them Monday with a pic of the broken cap. On Tuesday I received a email saying they were sending another one ups. I’m writing this on Wednesday expecting my new cap to show up tomorrow. Their customer service is outstanding. I can’t blame them for the broken cap things happen when shipping stuff. But they made it right no questions asked. So far it has been a pleasant experience and they’ll be the first place I look when I need parts in the future. They’ve earned my return business.
The guy on the phone when I ordered said they are discontinuing the tune up kits for my engines tho. That is disappointing so I’ll have to order everything individually next time. (Unless they read this and decide to continue with the tune up kits for my engines lol)
Take care and happy boating.

luke,0.6,"not designed for small space

The ac works well, but is not well designed for small spaces. This unit has a more square than rectangular footprint. Depending on your space, this could be an issue. Additionally, the seawater ports are positioned at the edge of the unit. Combined with the square shape the ports may be very close to a wall and make attaching hoses difficult. I was able to make it fit in my 27ft cabin cruiser, but just barely. Also, the electrical box is far larger than it needs to be. Overall, works well, but not great if space is an issue.

I ordered a oil sending unit with a bunch of other things it was part number 3857532. They updated me to a 3852215. This one has a spade tip and the old one has a screw on the tip. I only ordered it with a bunch of stuff because I was installing a new motor.

I ended up just reusing the old unit. Now I have spent $36 on a sending unit that I am not going to use because i don't want to start chopping up my wiring harness.

Other than littlie things here and there I do like this place. They ship out the parts fast. I give them 3 stars because I have mixed feeling about this place. They always seem to do a good job but sprinkle in a little misery along the way.

Three years ago I bought a Carver 360 Sport Sedan that had been neglected. I’ve been putting it back together. I needed the covers to the footpads for the anchor system. I called Carver and got the part number. They recommend Marine Parts Source. I went to the website put in the part number and there was what I was looking for. I put in quantity of two and went to check out. Five days later I had the parts. They look exactly what I need. I have not been able to put them on as my boat is in north Idaho which got six inches of snow the day I got the parts.

Good website to navigate, Good in stock selections, Prices very good comparable to others. Easy check out. Free ground delivery worth the wait,
The item I purchased was at least 50 LB (Mercruiser Exhaust Log)
Came with all the gaskets, studs and brass drain plug's

The exhaust gasket got crushed during shipping, No bodies fault sh@t happens. I picked a set up at my location performance shop cost $40
Glad it was that one easy to find and not the end cap’s or riser gaskets. Installed it same day as received.
Went together very easily….
Exhaust gasket could have been sandwiched in-between cardboard to protect it during shipping. Like the smaller gaskets were packaged with a stiff cardboard to protect them. No Big Deal
Not worried about it I upgraded to REM-FLEX Exhaust Gaskets.

I had to replace my trim lines and ordered them with the proper o rings etc only to find out from my mechanic that I should really just go ahead and put new trim cylinders on as well. After looking at the site I found an entire Trim rebuild kit for Volvo Penta but it did not list the part numbers. I sent an email Friday morning and asked for the part numbers in the kit and what they could do since I already bought some of the parts. They responded early Monday with every part number confirming it was the right parts for my boat and offered to have me return the original parts with no restocking fee. Finding Volvo Penta parts for a 2005 boat is no easy task.

Most companies would make this process painful. Marine Part Source went above and beyond helping me get the right parts to get my boat back on the water and the best possible price on parts needed.",US,1,2020-10-26T22:33:21Z,Marine Parts Source

Why you were not given a 5 star rating. This might not be your fault but then again its the service you offer. I purchased oil filters and fuel filters from you at a great price. The issue is the shipping.

The package was delivered timely however; it was placed on the ground at my mail box which is 50 yards from my door in the RAIN. No knock on the door telling us we have a package, it was just dumped on the roadside again in the RAIN. In case you are not aware, fuel and oil filters packed in cardboard do not work well when wet.

Howard,0.8,"Garmin Replacement Power Connector

Vendor’s description of part, availability and fulfillment were all top quality. The part delivered was exactly as depicted on their web site and fulfillment was quick. Pricing is an entirely different story.

The part ordered was a relatively inexpensive component. In practical terms, with an appropriate part number and time to scan the Internet, the part would likely be found for under $2.00.

However, Garmin does not provide detailed information that enables a consumer to find such discrete components from third party vendors. So, this consumer was forced to pay a price hundreds of times higher than the actual material cost of the item.

It should be noted, the company did have the part in stock and, for that reason alone, I was willing to pay the higher than desired price and remain mostly satisfied with my dealings with this company.",US,2,2020-09-18T15:07:49Z,Marine Parts Source

Have had 2 issues with known back order items. First time back order items were dropped out of the system due to a change in distributors. When i called back for update, the original order no longer showed a back order but a person checked and said back order had been ordered. Couple of weeks later, still no update however, a different person realized distributor order not in system, placed order and items were shipped to me a week later.
Recently, I placed an order and clicked on order entry box to ship instock items immediately and back ordered items when available. I called on 2nd day to be sure instock items were scheduled for shipment--told that order was being held for back order and that i would owe an additional shipping charge. I said this was OK and asked why in stock being held--she had no idea, processed new shipping charge and items shipped the next day.

Ordered a replacement steering cable w/rack, Seastar SSC13417(17') for my '00 Sea Ray 210 BR. Turn around was very quick not being too far from their base and they had the best price. But before ordering I spoke to one of their very knowledgeable advisers...most helpful. After receiving the replacement cable I proceeded to remove the existing cable, with the most difficult area being the connection in the back at the Mercruiser I/O steering lever, the cotter pin being on the under side of the connecting pin for safety. I called MPS again to reflect on my progress and best method for removing the entire cable from its configuration in the boat. Spoke to a different adviser who was also highly knowledgeable and gave me some possibilities for cutting the old cable for simple removal.

James Meyers,0.6,"Steering fin - no directions

The steering fin came without a mounting screw or directions. That turned out to be a big deal and a lot of hassle. The Volvo Penta steering fin has is tapped to about a 3/8"" 16 thread. Then a wire buffer is installed to bring it to a metric size. That thread reducer was screwed about half way down inside the tap. So by the time I figured all of this out I ruined a tap , but I did get the spring out. Retapping it to 3/8"" 16 finally solved the problem. Any information with this product would have saved a ton of screwing around.

The box received was loosely packaged resulting in parts knocking together and box starting to tear apart. Note I also ordered similar parts from Defender and their smaller box with individually wrapped parts and looked much more professional.

I don’t think the savings was worth the hassle so I am reluctant to order more from you.

Hi all,

I shop on line a lot and occasionally you get a bad company that simply doesn't care about their customers and I was concerned about this one after buying a very expensive marine water heater from them.
The item shipped rather quickly but unfortunately it arrived damaged so I was really upset and shot off an email wondering how this was going to go after having a few really bad experiences recently.
Well, Al emailed back and assured me that he would fix any problems or issues with the item and he did. Within two days he had fixed the problem and I cannot wait to buy form them again along with refer them to all of my boating friends. Thank you Al.

Matt,1.0,"Another Technique to Remove and Replace Steering Cables

The replacement steering cables (2) I purchased from Marine Parts Source for my 2012 Yamaha 242 Limited jet boat were perfect replacements. The post by Ryan Van Hoozer on March 5, 2018 was an extremely helpful guide in replacing the cables. I found Ryan's suggestion of using a pull rope to install the new cables helpful but found the rough inside of the hull was tearing up the pull rope concerning me that it would eventually break before the new cables made it through the hull. I opted to use a fiberglass fish tape (a tool used to pull electrical wiring through conduit). It made pulling the cables through the hull very easy with no trouble at all.",US,1,2020-04-28T16:04:03Z,Marine Parts Source

I've always gotten the items promptly. 2) Their shipping costs are a bit high, particularly if you order items that end up coming from two different warehouses.

Marine Parts Source had exactly what I needed. They did ship me the product but it took two weeks to get it. It was a dipstick for my boat engine. The new one was curved in a circle in its box. I had to manually bend it back to make it straight before I could use it . The handle on the dipstick was dirty as if it had been used. I did clean it with soap and water but it still doesn't look brand new . The dipstick itself had signs of early rust spots. The dipstick was $15. The cheapest shipping option was another $15. Amazon had a dipstick that may have worked but I wanted to match the original.",US,1,2019-12-20T15:47:05Z,Marine Parts Source

Gaskets are just what I needed to put between the exhaust manifold and the water cooled upper exhaust manifold. I have not installed the gasket yet, but it looks like just what I needed.",US,1,2019-09-17T04:07:22Z,Marine Parts Source

Bob Carroll,1.0,"I very seldom post my experience…

I very seldom post my experience regarding purchases that I make on line. However, I feel compelled to share an experience that I had with Jeff Barr (spelling?) on Friday, August 16, 2019. I was working on a Racor sea strainer on my Carver 46 MY and noticed a crack in the top. The crack got worse when I attempted to replace it, thus taking one of my engines out of service until it was replaced. My wife and I live on the boat and travel regularly.
I contacted Marine Parts Source at 4:50 PM and spoke with Jeff. After explaining my problem, he told me that he would research the correct part number and call me back. Jeff called me again at 5:20 PM. I had already sent Jeff an order for some other parts minus the top for the Racor. After speaking with Jeff, he changed my order and agreed to drop the additional shipping for the new Racor cap. I had also requested overnight air shipping. I knew the parts would not go out on Friday due to the time. However, I was again pleasantly surprised to receive a call from Jeff on Monday morning to inform me that all items were available at their Tennessee warehouse and would indeed arrive next day via UPS ground, thus saving me the additional expense. The parts arrived Tuesday morning and we were back in business shortly afterwards. I am extremely grateful to Jeff and the team at Marine Parts Sourxe for the excellent service and support. I have no interest in the company, just another very happy customer.",US,1,2019-08-23T22:28:19Z,Marine Parts Source

Kurt Kujawa,0.2,"Who said free shipping.

Dealing with these folks and their shipping was nothing but aggravation. A $190 free shipping item ended up costing me $200.64 when I refused the Item off the truck. 30 days went by when I got my credit card statement I looked for a credit from Marine parts source. Since I refused delivery I thought it would return but no sorry we don't do that. I contacted Ebay they told me that I should get a refund. I did $78 short of the billed price. MPS and Pay Pal sure can turn things to DO DO quick. I had to beg them back for that. The whole thing would still be in limbo if I would never have pushed the issue. DO DO business people keep away. REPLY REPLY HOW VERY KIND OF YOU TO GIVE SOME OF MY MONEY BACK . I EXPECTED SOME SHIPPING COSTS BUT IT WAS AN UNOPENED ITEM THAT NEVER LEFT THE DELIVERY TRUCK. COMMON SENSE WOULD TELL YOU IF YOUR BEING STIFFED BY A SERVICES (EBAY,PAYPAL) CHANGE THINGS. LIKE GOVERNMENT OVERREACH CHANGE IS NEEDED.",US,1,2019-08-03T16:42:56Z,Marine Parts Source

I wasn't told the truth about where my item was when it didn't get delivered on time. One person I talked to said it was out on Fed-Ex but their computer was down so he couldn't track it for me. That info was a lie! Another person I contacted told me it would be delivered sometime that day (7-24-19), that didn't happen! Another person told me it was out for delivery on 7-25-19 by end of day, another lie. Finally LTL called me and confirmed delivery for Friday 7-26-19, which is when it was delivered. My installer couldn't wait any longer, so after 7-24-19 it became a moot point and I have an a/c unit sitting on my boat uninstalled. NOT HAPPY!!!!!",US,2,2019-07-31T17:30:41Z,Marine Parts Source

Good service but Extremly expensive parts ( manufacture cost max 50cent)

Including freight for 50gram.
Only half delivery, I ordered a clutch set, parts for twin morse control and only got for 1 handle of 2 so I cant use it and will never order again.
Sorry for that

Mark Harper,0.2,"Horrible Cust Service froma company that does not stand behind their products.

The absolute worst customer service experience I have ever seen. After purchasing a part, that turned out to be defective out of the box, this company will not stand behind their part and replace it. They are telling me that I have to go through the manufacturer and have them replace it, which will take several weeks while the boat is down and unusable. Could have saved a customer if they had taken the part back, replaced it and then dealt with the manufacturer themselves. Meanwhile my only recourse to get the boat motor running in a reasonable time is to purchase another unit (from a different company this time!) and get the motor running. Marine Parts Source - My money will not be going to your lousy company.

UPDATE: Since they wont let me reply to Marine Part Source's reply to my review, I will edit this and do it here. I only asked that if you are going to send me a defective part, that you actually stand behind an item you sell and simply replace it. I did not ask for a refund, only a part that works that I paid for.",US,1,2018-10-19T20:28:15Z,Marine Parts Source

Michael W,0.2,"Warning!! Bait and switch fuel pump this is a CARTER pump

The part was shipped promptly and customer service was good. However I ordered a Sierra replacement electric pump and what I received was a Carter. If I knew they were sending a Carter instead of what I bought I would have bought it from Summit Racing for half the price. The Carter pumps are total junk made in China. I have had two of them Short out this year (same model number pumps that I ordered for $70) I am disappointed that I received an inferior product that was marketed as Sierra Marine product. I was told that Sierra is now having Carter produce their pumps. I highly doubt that.

Please follow this link to the same exact pump (Carter) that I was sold under the Sierra brand at a premium price. Google the following and you will see other negative reviews on this product. ""Electric Fuel Pump for carbureted Volvo Penta 3858261 reviews""

This product that was manufactured by Carter is know to have shorting problems.",US,1,2018-08-17T17:54:12Z,Marine Parts Source

To get quick delivery of a ten dollar part (a drive belt for a bilge pump), this vendor charged me $31+ for UPS second day air. It did not arrive in two days and could have been sent via USPS priority mail for a few dollars. The vendor should offer other delivery options. I would have given only one star, except that this was practically the only source for this much needed part to be delivered in less than several weeks. For that, it gets an extra star.

indicator and gauges. It was over all a few hours of time. I was treated well and he had patience walking me through it. An internet search found this company, price made me call,
Thanks Kevin!

Clear Skies!

Placed a order with Marine parts source, for ignition wire and dist. cap, first told me the wire would have to be ordered and it would be 5-7 days which was fine, I wanted to purchase from the state I was in, after 8 days I called and guy told me he didn't know when it would be in, now on 11th day they still have no clue when it will be in, talked to guy and he said must be on back order, think its very poor service when they wont even try to trace or call to find out and at least call or email me to let me know the status. getting ready to rebuild another Mercury outboard and I sure wont but my parts from this company, I like good customer service and at least good communication , When I called again I told the man I was just going to cancel the whole order, "" no big deal"" what kind of answer is that from customer service. Think he should have at least worked with me. Guess that's the difference when people work at a job or take pride in their job. Wouldn't recommend this company to anyone.

I placed my order and was charged $35 shipping. Once my order arrived I was charged an additional $57 by UPS COD. With the US exchange and the shipping and COD my order ended up costing me a lot more than if I just bought it in Canada. I will not make that mistake again.

Very pleased! I ordered my parts on Monday morning and told them I just needed it by Friday. They explained that standard shipping was free. My parts arrived the next day! Granted they shipped from WI to MN, but still very pleased.

I needed to replace a discharge pump on a VacuFlush system, and they've made several models of pumps through the years. My CSR worked with me over the phone to make sure I got the right model. I took a picture with my phone and emailed it so he could match it up with an actual pump. Then I had a question about the number and type of duckbill valves I needed -- he walked into the warehouse, pulled a pump from the shelf and went through the box to make certain I had everything I needed. The pump shipped the same day and I had it two days later. Awesome!

I ordered a trim pump cover for my boat on 12-28-16 at 1:38pm est expecting it to ship the same day as it is clearly stated on their website that all orders placed by 2:00pm est will ship the same day. I found the part $30 cheaper elsewhere, but chose MPS due to same day shipping. 2 days after ordering I still did not receive an email with shipping info so I called only to find out they were closed for the holidays and would not reopen until Tuesday 1-3-17. I called that morning explaining my issue and asked if they could expedite the shipping get due to the error on their behalf. I was told if I was willing to pay and additional $26 they would do 2 day shipping. I asked to speak to a manager and explained the same thing to him.

I had to call today to find out where my order was and found out that it was being returned to Marinepartssource because UPS does not deliver to a PO Box. When I placed my order I gave my delivery address to my Home and my billing address for my CC which is my PO Box. The person I just spoke with stated that he saw that and was sorry for the mix up and said he would send my order to my home and that I should receive it by next Tuesday. This is my first order with Marinepartssource and I'm not sure if I would order again. Regards. Captain Manuel Perry Lighthouse Marine Training.",GB,1,2016-12-16T22:30:35Z,Marine Parts Source

Keith,0.2,"Awful service

This company should be ashamed of how they do business. I had ordered some Marine coolant/ exhaust hose. I placed my order over the phone so I could check the prices of shipping due to the fact that I needed this hose as soon as possible. I found that priority shipping would cost more than the hose and had to settle for the standard shipping. I confirmed that the order would be sent out that day or the next. Ok, I figured at worst I might have to wait their generic 7-10 business days to my part to show up. So on the 11 day I call to find out the status of where my part is ( I also hadn't been sent any tracking info). I spoke when a representative who said that they would check on the status and call me back with details. I had to be out of town for a few days. When I returned nearly two and a half weeks had passed since my order and I figured my parts would be waiting for me. Still nothing, no calls or messages, no emails. I contact them again and again am told that someone will check status and report back. Two hours later I call back and am told that the order still hasn't been shipped because they only had part of my order in stock, and didn't know when they would receive the rest. I inquired as to why no one had bothered to inform me and could not receive an intelligent answer. I asked if they could overnight me the stock they did have, and they proceeded to quote me for the additional shipping costs. Three weeks later still no parts or identifiable time of arrival I canceled my order. I never write reviews but made point on this because of how poorly I was treated. This job has been delayed over month and they wouldn't try to help or even inform me so that I could make other arrangements. Needless to say I won't be doing any further business with them.",US,1,2016-08-19T19:20:35Z,Marine Parts Source
